            " we shall see more scrutiny of whether amazon, which dominates ecommerce outside china, has an unfair advantage against its own suppliers — since it both owns the network and also sells its own products on it, thus competing against them. history records that 19th century us railway companies, which owned networks and conducted commerce on them, were broken up as monopolies. already, regulators are looking into whether big tech’s forays into finance and healthcare may break existing privacy rules in those industries. but perhaps the biggest 2020 battle will be between the us and china which, despite a recent trade agreement, will continue to fight for control of the high-growth industries of the future.  each side has its warriors, whether tech companies (google, apple, amazon and facebook in the us; baidu, tencent and alibaba in china), or chipmakers (qualcomm versus huawei). one likely impact will be the continued “decoupling” of the us and chinese tech supply chains. this is supported by the trump administration and odd bedfellows from rightwing defence hawks to progressive labour advocates.  the same goes in china, where a nationalistic government seeks to ringfence the entire innovation ecosystem and make the middle kingdom independent from western technology within a few years. at the same time, it wants to spread the power, wealth and standards of the surveillance state into a host of new countries in europe, africa, the middle east and beyond. this battle could give cover to the us big tech companies. they will continue to position themselves as “national champions” in the fight against china.\n",
            "membership of a customs union would mean that the uk would have to impose tariffs on non-eu goods and would not be at liberty to strike its own trade deals independently of brussels. but the cbi says this is a spreadsheet issue: the government should weigh up whether the freedom to cut trade deals with the us or china is worth putting up trade barriers with its biggest export market for. \n",
            " those who know china and the us well were hopeful for a trade deal, but no one expected an end to an increasingly adversarial relationship. “the trade war is not about a trade war, it’s about the rise of china,” an executive with ties in beijing told me. and then there was huawei, the chinese telecoms group under growing international suspicion that its equipment could be used for spying. for the first time in years, the davos programme included a huawei dinner with journalists. over crab salad and baked salmon, company representatives insisted huawei was independent and would never be at risk of government interference. finally, there was george soros, whose annual dinner at the hotel seehof is his chance to reflect on the state of the world. the billionaire philanthropist labours so much over his yearly speech that when i met him back in december he refused to discuss china because he was saving it for davos. it was certainly a big, bold message: china’s technological advance, warned mr soros, made president xi jinping the most dangerous opponent of open societies and he implored the us not to let up in challenging china.\n",
            " being locked up on foreign soil used not to be a concern of executives in an age of global commerce, but it has turned into a risk for a few. former nissan chairman carlos ghosn was arrested on arrival in japan in november. meng wanzhou, finance chief of chinese technology company huawei, was recently detained in canada. this is the most visible symptom of the chill that has fallen over international commerce. with president donald trump declaring that “trade wars are good, and easy to win” and technology companies from both the us and china losing their lustre, businesses have been caught in an upsurge in nationalism and protectionism. it looked very different some years ago to world economic forum attendees. the davos anti-globalisation protests of the turn of the millennium faded as the mood shifted towards the benefits of economies such as india and china joining a global trading system. china’s accession to the world trade organization in 2001 was a turning point. the rise of china first as a workshop for global manufacturing, and increasingly as an economic power in its own right, was regarded as making the cake bigger for everyone. the emergence of indian outsourcing companies such as infosys showed how a global labour market operated. before the 2008 crisis, multinational commerce seemed to go hand in hand with shared prosperity. multinationals face scrutiny over intellectual property and cyber security. huawei has been a prime target, with the us pushing allies including the uk to remove huawei equipment from broadband networks. to no avail, huawei has argued it is independent of the chinese state security apparatus. cyber security is one way in which corporations are increasingly seen as instruments of their home countries’ political ambitions. the growth of china, along with its financial, technology and resources companies, has led to tensions, not only with the us but european countries including germany. china’s belt and road initiative, offering up to $1tn for development in 70 countries, has created strategic competition with the us and europe. particularly in africa, this has put chinese companies in a leading position.\n",
            "beijing — whatever deal washington and beijing reach over the trade war, president trump has already scored a big victory: companies are rethinking their reliance on china.  the two sides are nearing an agreement, with mr. trump saying on thursday that an “epic” trade pact could be weeks away and that he may soon meet with president xi jinping, china’s top leader. but already, spurred by tariffs and trade tensions, global companies are beginning to shift their supply chains away from china, just as some trump administration officials had wanted.  the move, known as decoupling, is a major goal of those who believe the world has grown far too dependent on china as a manufacturing giant. as beijing builds up its military and extends its geopolitical influence, some officials fear that america’s dependence on chinese factories makes it strategically vulnerable.  now companies in a number of industries are reducing their exposure to china. gopro, the mobile camera maker, and universal electronics, which makes sensors and remote controls, are shifting some work to mexico. hasbro is moving its toy making to the united states, mexico, vietnam and india. aten international, a taiwanese computer equipment company, brought work back to taiwan. danfoss, a danish conglomerate, is changing the production of heating and hydraulic equipment to the united states. mr. trump’s victory in this department is not unalloyed. despite his promises to bring jobs back to the united states, most of the work is shifting to other countries with lower costs. reshaping global supply chains also takes time, and china will remain a vital manufacturing hub for decades to come. still, chief executives say the trade war has prompted a fundamental reassessment of china as the dominant place to make things. even chinese companies are expanding overseas, although they still have most of their production in china.  “china was the factory of the world,” said song zhiping, the communist party chief at the china national building materials group, a state-owned giant. “things are changing. that’s why chinese companies are going out of china.” a spokeswoman for the united states trade representative’s office declined to comment. while mr. trump portrays his trade fight as a clash over jobs, proponents of decoupling within the administration see the effort as a way of contending with a stronger, more aggressive china.  already, china dominates the market for items like solar panels, and has emerged as the world’s largest producer of cars, car parts and many other sophisticated products. it plans to build jetliners, advanced computer chips, electric cars and other goods of the future. any deal is likely to leave in place new american tariffs on cars, aircraft parts, equipment for nuclear power plants and other items that administration officials see as essential for economic and security reasons. but more broadly, the trade hawks hope companies in other industries will also find friendlier countries in which to do business. china emerged as a manufacturing powerhouse over the past two decades. the work force was low cost and relatively skilled. the communist party prevented the emergence of independent labor unions. subcontractors abounded, meaning companies could strongly negotiate for lower supply costs. china built an extensive network of highways and rail lines. it has a vast and growing local customer base, meaning companies don’t have to go far to sell their products.  businesses flocked there. china accounted for one-quarter of the world’s manufacturing by value last year, up from 8 percent in 2000, according to the united nations industrial development organization. the value created in china by manufacturing last year was bigger than in the united states, germany and south korea combined.  but wages and other costs in china have been rising for years. a growing number of businesses complain that chinese officials too often favor local competitors or don’t do enough to stop intellectual property theft. the prospect of more trade fights only adds to the reasons to diversify, which also include threats elsewhere like mr. trump’s threat to close the border with mexico and britain’s troubled exit from the european union. “localization will matter more,” joe kaeser, the chief executive of siemens, one of germany’s largest conglomerates, said in an interview late last month on the sidelines of the china development forum in beijing. “you’re more resilient to political discussions.” china may not necessarily oppose some of the efforts to decouple. beijing has long hoped to shed low-skilled, polluting manufacturing jobs and move higher up the value chain.  “the total size of the work force is falling, the labor cost is rising and we are losing our competitive advantage in low-cost industries,” miao wei, china’s minister of industry and information technology, said at the china development forum. he added that the country would focus instead on high-tech, innovative industries.  still, chinese officials must walk a fine line. as the country’s economy slows, an abrupt shift of work out of china could lead to job losses and instability. decoupling efforts appear to be in their early stages. a broad survey by ubs of chief financial officers at export-oriented manufacturers in china late last year found that a third had moved at least some production out of china in 2018. another third intended to do so this year. the typical company was moving the production for about 30 percent of its exports, ubs found. companies now want to depend less on one place, which means looking for an alternative to china, bill winters, the chief executive of standard chartered bank, said at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, this year.  “people who are concerned at the prospect of greater tariffs on chinese exports, for example, are looking to move export facilities from china to other countries, including chinese companies,” mr. winters said.  countries seeking to displace china have begun pointing out that exports from their countries are less likely to face tariffs.  for companies with operations in china, “the trade war between the united states and china creates a new uncertainty,” airlangga hartarto, indonesia’s minister of industry, said in an interview in davos. the ability to diversify depends on the industry. some auto parts companies have run their american factories more hours each day to avoid tariffs on chinese-made goods, said razat gaurav, the chief executive of llamasoft, a supply chain management company in ann arbor, mich.  by contrast, he said, manufacturers of smartphones and smartphone components — which have generally not been hit by mr. trump’s tariffs — have found few places to move work because china dominates that supply chain. still, some in that industry are shifting too, such as sony’s closure of a beijing smartphone factory last month after expanding production in thailand. for now, companies are looking for alternatives. steve madden, the shoe company, is moving production to cambodia. hasbro, the world’s leading toymaker, has a goal for the end of next year “to be 60 percent out of china,” by shifting production to the united states and elsewhere, brian goldner, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said in a recent conference call.  though much of the work leaving china is going to other low-cost countries, some companies are following mr. trump’s suggestion that they move production to the united states. danfoss, a danish maker of heating and cooling systems as well as sensors and transmitters, has seen rising costs in china, especially for skilled labor, said kim fausing, the company’s chief executive and president. it is also looking for ways to reduce transportation-related emissions of global warming gases. when danfoss bought an american heating systems company a year ago and found that the company had recently shifted some work to china, it acted quickly. “the first thing we did after we acquired it was we moved everything back” to the united states, where danfoss already had a dozen factories, mr. fausing said. the first round of 25 percent tariffs that mr. trump put in place last july included hydraulic parts long manufactured by danfoss in northeastern china. the company transferred production of these parts to the united states as well. “there is not much of a difference between the costs in china and the united states,” mr. fausing said. “you have to have a very good case today to justify producing something in china and shipping it to the u.s.” ana swanson contributed reporting from washington. \n",
            "minneapolis — when liu jingyao introduced herself, in the lobby of her apartment building, i didn’t recognize her. it was a puzzling feeling. for an entire year, photos of her had blanketed the chinese internet. like tens of millions of other chinese, i had watched and rewatched surveillance video of her in this very building. she was one of the most talked about and mysterious women in china, and i thought i knew what she looked like. in the video, she wanders the halls of a mazelike building, with a man trailing along. they get in and out of several elevators. she seems unsure about how to get to her apartment. she wears striking waist-length hair and a long, dark knit dress. she doesn’t look glamorous, exactly, but for a 21-year-old college junior, she is dressed smartly. but on a morning in early august, she greeted me in a loosefitting checkered dress. now 22, she looked pale and nervous. her lips were chapped. she invited me upstairs, and began an intense conversation that continued for 18 straight hours. in the summer of 2018, ms. liu, a student at the university of minnesota, alleged that the billionaire founder of one of china’s largest companies, jd.com, followed her back to her apartment and raped her. the executive, known as liu qiangdong in china and richard liu in the english-speaking world, was arrested by minneapolis police and released within 24 hours. (he and ms. liu are not related.) he insisted that the sex was consensual, and prosecutors declined to charge him. in april, ms. liu accused mr. liu of rape in a minnesota civil court, seeking more than $50,000 in damages. but hers is not a typical #metoo story. after her name became common knowledge on the chinese internet, ms. liu was widely called a slut, a whore, a liar, a gold digger and many other things. it may be difficult for westerners to grasp the scale and intensity of her online shaming. but the monica lewinsky frenzy is a good comparison, had it taken place in the era of twitter and youtube in a country with 800 million internet users and no independent news media. when ms. liu and i met, it was the first time she had ever spoken to an english-language publication about what she has endured. in her apartment, a 500-square-foot studio, ms. liu showed me photos of trips she had taken to morocco, greece and spain, before all that had happened. she looked different then. her eyes were brighter, and her smile looked unreserved. she said she had thrown away half of her cosmetics and no longer wore makeup. like many young chinese, she used to like designer clothes and handbags; now she mostly wears muji, the inexpensive japanese brand whose style reputation in china might be described as dowdy and demure. when ms. liu transferred to the university a year ago, she chose the high-floor apartment for its view of a nearby park and a water tower known to locals as the witch’s hat. now, she said, she keeps the blinds down day and night. “i always have a feeling that someone is watching me from outside,” she said. “i want to be as inconspicuous as possible.” it’s an understandable concern, given the social-media attention directed at ms. liu, which has been vast and often vicious. on weibo, china’s equivalent of twitter, her case has been one of the most popular topics of the last two years. “the woman is a slut,” one commenter said. “the woman looks disgusting,” commented another. “it was obvious that they disagreed on the price,” added a third. “looks like the woman set up the whole thing.” and one suggested that mr. liu was the actual victim, writing, “look at the woman’s build, i absolutely believe that liu qiangdong was raped.” these are just a few of the 8,500 comments on a single weibo post, which was retweeted 14,000 times and liked by 95,000 users. now imagine this, and worse, at scale, for months and months. many of the most active hashtags related to the case, including #richardliulawsuit and #richardliusexualassault, have been disabled on weibo. but even less popular hashtags regarding the case get an astonishing amount of attention. one, which has to do with a denial that mr. liu was getting divorced, has 170 million views. another, which concerns a defamation lawsuit mr. liu filed against a chinese blogger, has 130 million views. a hashtag about a pretrial hearing in september has logged 110 million views. followers of the case quickly translate legal documents into chinese and add subtitles to police audio and video. in some ways, ms. liu has become a figure as polarizing as president trump. in july, the morning after the minneapolis police released a report on the case, i got into a debate with a friend, and i suggested that she might want to read the document first before jumping to conclusions. my friend, an accomplished career woman and busy mother, replied that she had indeed read it — all 149 pages, in english, overnight, purely out of curiosity. ms. liu’s case is attracting so much attention because she is accusing one of the country’s most powerful men of behavior that has long been ignored. sexual harassment and assault are widespread in china, and elites face little scrutiny. the workings of government and the private lives of national leaders are off-limits to the news media. self-made tech tycoons are widely admired celebrities. among this class of billionaires, mr. liu is one of the most high-profile. born in a village in the eastern province of jiangsu, he likes to recount how his family was able to afford meat only once or twice a year, and how he went to college with $70 raised by his fellow villagers. he founded jd.com in the early days of chinese e-commerce, and turned the company into a logistics colossus. mr. liu became an entrepreneurial icon, known for putting on a helmet and jd.com’s red uniform to personally make deliveries on a three-wheeled electric bike one day a year.  mr. liu only got more famous in 2015, when he married a 21-year-old student and internet celebrity named zhang zetian. by the summer of 2018, when he traveled to minnesota, he was worth an estimated $7.5 billion. ms. liu grew up in beijing, introverted and intense, the only child of an affluent family. her father was a businessman, and her mother, ms. liu said, was strict and quick to scold or punish her physically. she only allowed ms. liu to wear her hair short. today, ms. liu’s waist-length cut is an act of rebellion. in 2016, she went to a liberal arts college in minnesota to study literature, while also practicing piano two and half hours a day. she dreamed of becoming a diplomat or a professor of linguistics, but she was also interested in business. she transferred to the university of minnesota’s carlson school of management in august 2018, where a professor recruited her to volunteer with a program for visiting international executives. one of them was mr. liu. every morning, ms. liu got up early and took the executive visitors jogging. on the fifth day, she was invited to a group dinner at a japanese restaurant. when ms. liu arrived, she found that she was the only volunteer — and the only woman — at a table of about a dozen middle-aged chinese men. surveillance video shows that one of the men directed her to sit next to mr. liu, the most accomplished and wealthiest member of the group. at chinese business dinners, it is common for pretty young women to be placed next to powerful men to laugh at their lewd jokes. in the next two hours, according to the police, members of the party raised their glasses of red wine in at least 27 toasts. ms. liu drank 19 times. the man sitting across from her passed out on the table and had to be carried away. after dinner, ms. liu left in a limousine with mr. liu and two of his female assistants. they drove to a house rented by one of the executives, but ms. liu didn’t want to go in. the chauffeur, whose name is redacted in police reports, later told officers that he saw ms. liu and mr. liu talking in front of his car. “then he grabbed her arm, kind of overpower her and bring her to my car in the back,” the chauffeur said, according to a transcript. “i look in my mirror and this guy was all over this girl.” then, he said, one of mr. liu’s assistants pushed the mirror up to obscure the chauffeur’s view. the chauffeur told the police that he didn’t hear anyone saying “stop” or “no,\" or cry for help. mr. liu went with ms. liu to her apartment. a few hours later, a friend of hers reported to the police that ms. liu had told him, via a messaging app, that she had been raped. a spokesman for mr. liu denied that account, saying, “the evidence released by the minneapolis police department, including the written police report and surveillance video, does not support the accusations that have been made.” when i met with ms. liu, she said that she seldom left her apartment anymore and that she spends most of her time cooking, drawing, playing piano, watching japanese soap operas and struggling with whether to check chinese social-media platforms. each night, she double-checked her door lock before going to bed. on her nightstand were a canister of pepper spray and a stun gun that she purchased after that evening. ms. liu said she had a recurring nightmare: a man forcing her down and sitting on top of her. her psychiatrist told her that it was a common symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. she said that during nights of insomnia, she would replay in her head how she should have handled the situation differently. she would try not to be intimidated by how powerful mr. liu was. she would definitely drink less. she would definitely not tell the police, when they arrived, “yes, i was raped, but not that kind of rape.” or wait two days before telling her parents that she was the woman in the biggest news of the week in china. or wait five days before getting a lawyer. or use the word “money” when telling mr. liu’s lawyer what she wanted, in addition to an apology, when the english word she meant to use was the more neutral “compensation.” “i was such a fool,” she said. “i was such a coward. i messed it up.” in 2018, encouraged by the #metoo movement elsewhere in the world, more than 50 chinese women came forward with their stories of being sexually harassed or assaulted. the men accused included professors, journalists and ngo organizers. some lost their jobs or resigned. but the fledgling movement started to lose its momentum just around the time of ms. liu’s allegation. men who had been publicly accused were starting to sue their accusers for defamation. #metoo victims faced criticism from even the most liberal-minded corners in china. most important of all, the chinese government — distrustful of independent social movements — clamped down on public discussion of gender issues. online allegations of sexual misconduct were one of the most heavily censored topics on wechat, china’s biggest social-media platform, in 2018, according to wechatscope, a research project at the university of hong kong. the hashtags #metoo and #woyeshi — a mandarin translation — were banned. some of the wechat accounts that voiced support for ms. liu were deleted. wechat is owned by tencent, which is also the biggest shareholder of jd.com. ms. liu’s experiences illustrate how chinese society treats women who dare to speak up about sexual assault. victims need to be seen as perfect to win any sympathy from the public, or they’ll be subject to immense slut-shaming. younger women who sleep with older and powerful men, willingly or unwillingly, face even more public distain. in december 2018, minneapolis prosecutors decided not to charge mr. liu with sexual assault because they did not find enough evidence to pursue a case against him. they made the announcement without meeting with ms. liu. she said that when she heard the news, she felt “as if the sky had fallen.” but what came next on the chinese internet was much worse. one major chinese news site posted an article headlined, “richard liu’s attorney: everything happened in the room was voluntary. woman repeatedly asked for money.” the story featured a lengthy statement from one of mr. liu’s lawyers, but nothing from ms. liu’s side. it got 14,000 comments. a well-respected former writer for the southern weekly, the country’s most liberal-leaning newspaper, shared the article on weibo with the comment, “richard liu isn’t guilty legally though he is morally. the woman is a cheap slut. she’s inviting humiliation.” a few days after ms. liu filed her lawsuit, in april 2019, a heavily edited video surfaced on the chinese internet. it was titled “proof of a gold digger trap?” and was cut to give the impression that ms. liu had invited mr. liu to her apartment for sex. it was posted to weibo by an account that had never posted anything before. one of mr. liu’s chinese lawyers wrote online that the video was “authentic,” and it was viewed more than 54 million times. numerous chinese websites published articles saying ms. liu had escorted mr. liu into her room. separately, one of china’s most influential newspapers published an edited audio clip, in which ms. liu can be heard asking mr. liu’s lawyer for an apology and money. news of the recording was reposted widely. taken together, the video and audio clip seemed to turn the whole of the chinese internet against ms. liu. in minneapolis, i asked her to estimate what proportion of news consumers in china believed her. initially, she said 30 percent. thinking about it longer, ms. liu said that there were probably just three types of people in her corner: women who have been sexually assaulted, feminists and people who know her. “definitely not 30 percent,” she said, a little defeated. “ten percent at best.” then ms. liu grew agitated. “i didn’t want to report to the police in the first place because i knew this would happen,” she said. “people would look at me and say, ‘there are too many holes in her story. she said she was drunk, but the way she walked in the video didn’t show it at all.’ but i didn’t say that i was so dead drunk that i couldn’t move.” she kept talking. “they said that i was pretending when i couldn’t find my apartment in the building. but if i were a real gold digger, why would i take a man running around in the building for 15 minutes to find my door? they questioned why i would take a man home in the middle of the night. but it was my home, and he was richard liu! who would have thought he would do that?” ms. liu said she felt powerless — that she couldn’t make the public see how scary it was for a 21-year-old to sit among a group of powerful middle-aged men, and how she couldn’t make the most powerful among them leave her alone. ms. liu couldn’t make them see how creepy it was that a 45-year-old billionaire, who mingled with the davos elite, followed a young woman around an apartment building that mostly housed students. she was angry at mr. liu’s two assistants and the other executives at the dinner: she saw them as complicit, but barely any public outrage had been directed at them. she continues to hide in her apartment with her two yorkshire terriers, waiting for developments in her lawsuit against mr. liu. her parents are working in china. her boyfriend has had visa trouble and can’t visit. ms. liu uses a pseudonym when ordering takeout food and ubers, for fear that she’ll encounter a chinese person who recognizes her name. during our long conversation, i asked ms. liu whether she thought her experience was similar to that of monica lewinsky. “of course not,” she said quickly. “i would never sleep with a married man voluntarily.” a week later, i sent her a link to ms. lewinsky’s ted talk, titled “the price of shame,” in which she argues for a more compassionate social-media environment. “public shaming as a blood sport has to stop,” ms. lewinsky says. “we’re so similar!” ms. liu told me a day later. “i truly admire her that after all that, she can still live a positive life. extraordinary!” then she added, “i’m such a loser that i don’t even dare to read the police report.” but ms. liu has, she said, turned out to be more resilient than she at first expected. true, she said, she suffers from ptsd and is sometimes suicidal. but she’s determined to pursue the case. she said she would not settle, because she would never agree to signing a nondisclosure agreement. if she won, she said, she would donate all the money to chinese feminists who have been supportive of her — except for $1,000, which she would keep for herself. she spent money on a flight to new york to find a lawyer. and she wants compensation, she said, for the clothes and bedsheets that were destroyed. “if i had known i could endure so much,” she said. “i would not have hesitated about reporting to the police.” \n",
            "hong kong — erik prince, a former member of the navy seals best known as the founder of the security contractor formerly known as blackwater, has made it clear that he considers china a priority. he teamed up with one of china’s biggest conglomerates and set up a company that would help chinese companies overseas. but mr. prince scrambled on friday to distance himself from the latest announcement: that his company, frontier services group, had struck a deal to build a training camp in the northwestern chinese region of xinjiang, where hundreds of thousands of muslims have been detained in indoctrination camps that have drawn condemnation in washington and abroad. frontier services group said in january that it had reached an agreement with officials and an industrial park in tumxuk, a city in western xinjiang, to build a training facility there. the announcement provided few details about what kind of training would take place there, though the company cast the project as a move to help upgrade the city through tourism and infrastructure projects. chinese media later reported that fsg would invest about $600,000 into the camp and train about 8,000 people a year. but on friday, in a statement provided by a spokesman, mr. prince said he had “no knowledge or involvement whatsoever” of what he called a “preliminary memorandum.” mr. prince added, “any potential investment of this nature would require the knowledge and input of each fsg board member and a formal board resolution.” by friday, the statement announcing the deal had been removed from the fsg website. mr. prince, who is the brother of the united states education secretary, betsy devos, has long courted controversy, most recently when he laid out a plan for president trump to privatize the war in afghanistan. blackwater, a united states military contractor in two asian conflicts, became a symbol of unchecked american power in the iraq war after its employees killed 17 unarmed civilians in baghdad in 2007. frontier services group has expressed interest in western china before. two years ago, it said it would set up an office in xinjiang, where the chinese authorities have taken an increasingly hard line on the local population, citing concerns about terrorism. xinjiang is home to a largely muslim ethnic minority group called uighurs. since then, a fuller, more disturbing picture has emerged. officials in xinjiang have rounded up ethnic uighurs and other muslim minority groups in huge numbers, putting them into re-education camps where they are subjected to a severe indoctrination program to remove any devotion to islam and make them obedient to the chinese communist party. experts, human rights groups, and officials in the united states and elsewhere estimate hundreds of thousands of people have been caught up in the campaign, part of an expansive crackdown that beijing has put in place in the name of fighting extremism and separatism. “xinjiang is a region where we have documented severe human rights abuses both by the police and ordinary officials,” said maya wang, a researcher for human rights watch. “anything that would involve training government officials involved in this repression would be contributing to human rights abuses.” united states officials have taken notice. lawmakers have introduced bipartisan bills that urge the trump administration to punish chinese officials and to prevent sales of some american equipment to some chinese state agencies. officials at the white house and in the state and treasury departments have been discussing whether to impose economic sanctions on chinese officials who oversee the system of repression in xinjiang. mr. prince made a name for himself as the founder of blackwater, a private military contractor that did business in iraq. after blackwater employees were held responsible for civilian deaths in baghdad, mr. prince sold the company and set up fsg, turning his sights to the growing demand from chinese companies moving into countries and regions with ethnic strife. fsg, which is listed in hong kong, has unabashedly courted chinese officialdom. citic group, one of china’s biggest state-owned conglomerates, owns a quarter of fsg’s stock. a security and logistics company, fsg has tied itself to china’s belt and road initiative, a major campaign by president xi jinping to develop geopolitical ties by building bridges, trains and ports through asia. china considers xinjiang, which borders kazakhstan and several other central asian countries, a gateway to a strategically important region. tumxuk lies between kashgar and aksu, larger settlements that have been a focus of the chinese government’s drive to stifle antigovernment sentiment. the city comes under the xinjiang production and construction corps, an organization run along military lines and founded in the 1950s to bring security, development and han chinese settlers — members of china’s largest ethnic group — to the region. even now, the corps acts as a kind of parallel administration in xinjiang, holding vast areas of land and operating its own schools, courts and other institutions. but tumxuk has also been drawn into the regionwide drive to transform uighur society through indoctrination camps. the government says the camps wean uighurs and other muslim minorities from religious extremism, while teaching them chinese language and job skills. but former inmates have described harsh, even brutal treatment, and united nations human rights committees and experts have condemned the camps for holding people in the camps without legal appeal. tumxuk has more than 160,000 inhabitants, nearly two-thirds of them uighur, according to official population estimates, and government reports and records show that the city has built at least one camp, as well as other specialized schools, to “deradicalize” minority residents. uighurs are nearly all sunni muslim. in the previous decade some of them embraced more conservative strains of islam, and xinjiang experienced bursts of violence directed at government targets and han chinese people. the chinese government said the violence was inspired and orchestrated by terrorists seeking an independent uighur homeland, but many experts outside the country said the attacks often appeared to be poorly organized local efforts. in 2017, a unit of the xinjiang production and construction corps in tumxuk issued a tender notice inviting bids for building work on a “legal education and training center” — a phrase sometimes used for the indoctrination camps. the work required included installing video surveillance equipment and renovating dormitories and a canteen for the inmates. in 2017, tumxuk also hosted a meeting of xinjiang production and construction corps officials to discuss the growing indoctrination drive, according to a corps report at the time. the fsg deal would have put the company in direct business with tumxuk officials. a news release that has since been removed from the fsg website included a photograph of local officials signing the memorandum. one was li zhenguo, the communist party secretary for tumxuk, who recently warned about the rise of terrorism in the region. according to a statement on the local government website on friday, mr. li recently implored local officials to “always be on alert in the war against separatism and terrorism.” \n",

priority. he teamed up with one of china’s biggest conglomerates and set up a company that would help chinese companies overseas. but mr. prince scrambled on friday to distance himself from the latest announcement: that his company, frontier services group, had struck a deal to build a training camp in the northwestern chinese region of xinjiang, where hundreds of thousands of muslims have been detained in indoctrination camps that have drawn condemnation in washington and abroad. frontier services group said in january that it had reached an agreement with officials and an industrial park in tumxuk, a city in western xinjiang, to build a training facility there. the announcement provided few details about what kind of training would take place there, though the company cast the project as a move to help upgrade the city through tourism and infrastructure projects. chinese media later reported that fsg would invest about $600,000 into the camp and train about 8,000 people a year. but on friday, in a statement provided by a spokesman, mr. prince said he had “no knowledge or involvement whatsoever” of what he called a “preliminary memorandum.” mr. prince added, “any potential investment of this nature would require the knowledge and input of each fsg board member and a formal board resolution.” by friday, the statement announcing the deal had been removed from the fsg website. mr. prince, who is the brother of the united states education secretary, betsy devos, has long courted controversy, most recently when he laid out a plan for president trump to privatize the war in afghanistan. blackwater, a united states military contractor in two asian conflicts, became a symbol of unchecked american power in the iraq war after its employees killed 17 unarmed civilians in baghdad in 2007. frontier services group has expressed interest in western china before. two years ago, it said it would set up an office in xinjiang, where the chinese authorities have taken an increasingly hard line on the local population, citing concerns about terrorism. xinjiang is home to a largely muslim ethnic minority group called uighurs. since then, a fuller, more disturbing picture has emerged. officials in xinjiang have rounded up ethnic uighurs and other muslim minority groups in huge numbers, putting them into re-education camps where they are subjected to a severe indoctrination program to remove any devotion to islam and make them obedient to the chinese communist party. experts, human rights groups, and officials in the united states and elsewhere estimate hundreds of thousands of people have been caught up in the campaign, part of an expansive crackdown that beijing has put in place in the name of fighting extremism and separatism. “xinjiang is a region where we have documented severe human rights abuses both by the police and ordinary officials,” said maya wang, a researcher for human rights watch. “anything that would involve training government officials involved in this repression would be contributing to human rights abuses.” united states officials have taken notice. lawmakers have introduced bipartisan bills that urge the trump administration to punish chinese officials and to prevent sales of some american equipment to some chinese state agencies. officials at the white house and in the state and treasury departments have been discussing whether to impose economic sanctions on chinese officials who oversee the system of repression in xinjiang. mr. prince made a name for himself as the founder of blackwater, a private military contractor that did business in iraq. after blackwater employees were held responsible for civilian deaths in baghdad, mr. prince sold the company and set up fsg, turning his sights to the growing demand from chinese companies moving into countries and regions with ethnic strife. fsg, which is listed in hong kong, has unabashedly courted chinese officialdom. citic group, one of china’s biggest state-owned conglomerates, owns a quarter of fsg’s stock. a security and logistics company, fsg has tied itself to china’s belt and road initiative, a major campaign by president xi jinping to develop geopolitical ties by building bridges, trains and ports through asia. china considers xinjiang, which borders kazakhstan and several other central asian countries, a gateway to a strategically important region. tumxuk lies between kashgar and aksu, larger settlements that have been a focus of the chinese government’s drive to stifle antigovernment sentiment. the city comes under the xinjiang production and construction corps, an organization run along military lines and founded in the 1950s to bring security, development and han chinese settlers — members of china’s largest ethnic group — to the region. even now, the corps acts as a kind of parallel administration in xinjiang, holding vast areas of land and operating its own schools, courts and other institutions. but tumxuk has also been drawn into the regionwide drive to transform uighur society through indoctrination camps. the government says the camps wean uighurs and other muslim minorities from religious extremism, while teaching them chinese language and job skills. but former inmates have described harsh, even brutal treatment, and united nations human rights committees and experts have condemned the camps for holding people in the camps without legal appeal. tumxuk has more than 160,000 inhabitants, nearly two-thirds of them uighur, according to official population estimates, and government reports and records show that the city has built at least one camp, as well as other specialized schools, to “deradicalize” minority residents. uighurs are nearly all sunni muslim. in the previous decade some of them embraced more conservative strains of islam, and xinjiang experienced bursts of violence directed at government targets and han chinese people. the chinese government said the violence was inspired and orchestrated by terrorists seeking an independent uighur homeland, but many experts outside the country said the attacks often appeared to be poorly organized local efforts. in 2017, a unit of the xinjiang production and construction corps in tumxuk issued a tender notice inviting bids for building work on a “legal education and training center” — a phrase sometimes used for the indoctrination camps. the work required included installing video surveillance equipment and renovating dormitories and a canteen for the inmates. in 2017, tumxuk also hosted a meeting of xinjiang production and construction corps officials to discuss the growing indoctrination drive, according to a corps report at the time. the fsg deal would have put the company in direct business with tumxuk officials. a news release that has since been removed from the fsg website included a photograph of local officials signing the memorandum. one was li zhenguo, the communist party secretary for tumxuk, who recently warned about the rise of terrorism in the region. according to a statement on the local government website on friday, mr. li recently implored local officials to “always be on alert in the war against separatism and terrorism.” \n",
            " just three years ago, chinese president xi jinping skillfully soothed european sensibilities at the annual gathering of global elites in davos, switzerland, as he praised the virtues of multilateralism, free trade and fighting climate change. to many europeans, china’s authoritarian leader briefly seemed a more appealing partner than president donald trump,  who has since withdrawn the u.s. from the paris climate treaty, disparaged the european union and questioned the value of nato. mr. xi’s ambitious belt and road project also made european politicians salivate over tens of billions of dollars in anticipated chinese infrastructure investments. copyright ©2019 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8 that infatuation is waning, however, as europe confronts china’s rise as a superpower and attempts to navigate a new international order that is shaped more and more by the rivalry between washington and beijing. china’s appeal has been further eroded by the secretive manner in which chinese authorities initially managed the outbreak of the wuhan coronavirus, which this week became a public-health emergency in italy and a threat to other european economies.        increasingly repressive at home under mr. xi, the chinese party-state is now trying to stifle public criticism abroad, including in europe. in recent months, these heavy-handed attempts to influence, and sometimes bully, european nations have triggered a backlash, drawing attention to the chinese system’s fundamental difference with western democracies. “china is trying to export its governance model across the word, including into europe,” said volker perthes, director of the german institute for international and security affairs, a think tank that advises germany’s government and parliament. “europe is waking up to dealing with china not only as a customer, a marketplace and a big factory, but as a geopolitical and geoeconomic actor that is certainly a partner in many respects but also a competitor and a challenger, including to our values.” positive views of china shrank in much of the eu last year, according to opinion polls. in sweden, one of several european countries experiencing this new chill with beijing, things have gotten so nasty recently that three major parties have demanded the expulsion of the chinese ambassador to stockholm, citing his public threats to swedish officials, media and human-rights groups. “some swedish businesses now have to take into account swedish public opinion: ‘why do you do business in china, such a terrible country?’ that is quite new,” said lars freden, a former swedish ambassador to beijing. europe’s expected belt and road bonanza, meanwhile, has by and large failed to materialize as china’s own economy has slowed down—troubles that began well before the stringent measures to contain the coronavirus. “the period of romantic optimism is over,” said latvia’s foreign minister edgars rinkevics. “four years ago it was only about the economy, about trade, about the belt and road, about more investment. now, it is more balanced.” a fellow minister from a major eu nation put it less diplomatically. “frankly, we see no reason why we should be kneeling to china,” he said. “they are not doing us any favors.” china remains vital to the european economy, of course, and retains a network of influence on the continent. bilateral trade stood at 604 billion euros ($665 billion) in 2018, the last year for which eu statistics are available, with a 185 billion euro deficit ($203 billion) in china’s favor. chinese companies have invested heavily in key pieces of europe’s infrastructure, like greece’s main port of pireaus and portugal’s power utility, and control iconic european manufacturers such as sweden’s volvo cars and italy’s pirelli. distracted by dealing with russia and with britain’s departure from the bloc, the eu is only now attempting to put together a coherent policy on china. perennial rivalries within the eu, where smaller states often suspect germany and france of skewing the rules in their own favor, have complicated the process. still, last march, the european commission for the first time defined china as a “systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance”—a departure from the previous approach that viewed china mostly through the lens of lucrative trade opportunities. european leaders are working to come up with a common position ahead of the summit between mr. xi and 27 eu leaders scheduled for september in the german city of leipzig. as this new attitude sets in, the overriding priority for europe is to avoid getting trampled by the two superpowers, eu officials say. “we europeans cannot accept the idea that the world should organize itself around a new sino-american bipolarity which would come to replace, after a 30-year transition period, the soviet-american bipolarity that literally divided europe,” said the eu’s top diplomat, josep borrell. europe’s sudden awakening to china’s growing clout, and to beijing’s threat to its democratic values, is happening at a time of profound discord with the u.s. mr. trump remains deeply unpopular in european nations, in part because of his threats of a trade war. at home, however, his desire to contain china has bipartisan support, which means that the pressure on europe to take sides is almost certain to continue whether or not mr. trump wins a second term in november. “we have two main worries now. are we still allies with the u.s.? and where is china heading with its authoritarian turn?” said france’s former prime minister jean-pierre raffarin,  who informally advises president emmanuel macron. “what’s at stake for us is to become strong enough that we don’t turn into a ping-pong ball hit by the american and chinese rackets.” while european leaders agree, in principle at least, that europe’s best response to this challenge is to grow its own capacities—in defense, technology, industry and diplomacy—there are two main schools of thought on the best strategy to achieve that goal.  one asserts that, regardless of the eu’s many disagreements with mr. trump, trans-atlantic ties are more essential than ever before and europe should stand firmly by america’s side. “the u.s. is not able to deal with china alone, and europe is not able to deal with china alone,” said latvia’s mr. rinkevics. “if you look at it from the values point of view, from the strategic point of view, the u.s. should be our number one partner in addressing these issues, even though it’s not an easy partner.” to other european leaders, however, this approach is rooted in wishful thinking. the u.s., they argue, already began disengaging from europe under president barack obama,  and eu interests are increasingly at odds with washington’s. this means that europe should stay out of the fight and pursue its own course. france’s president macron has pressed this point, insisting on greater “strategic autonomy” for europe and arguing for renewed engagement with russia to limit china’s power. such thinking reflects a major shift, from seeing russia as europe’s biggest security threat, in the wake of the 2014 invasion of ukraine, to realizing that china poses an even more severe challenge—economically, politically and even militarily. the surprisingly rapid expansion of china’s military base in djibouti—a former french colony on the horn of africa—has enabled china to project power in europe’s own neighborhood. to france, this point was made clear in july 2017, when chinese warships sailing in the mediterranean briefly outnumbered those of the french navy. chinese officials, in their meetings with europeans, insist that beijing’s intentions are nothing but benign. “the world today needs solidarity and cooperation between china and europe,” chinese foreign minister wang yi said at the munich security conference in february. “china-eu cooperation has become even more significant, especially in today’s world where a certain major country has abandoned international cooperation and pursued unilateralism. china always believes that for china and the eu, our areas of consensus outweigh differences.” such assurances meet an increasingly skeptical response, however, in part because of a new pattern of behavior by chinese government representatives. these days in europe, public discussion of matters such as the treatment of the uighur minority in xinjiang, protests in hong kong or the chinese authorities’ initial mishandling of the wuhan coronavirus often prompts angry public interventions by chinese diplomats. from stockholm to prague to rome, the chinese message is: keep quiet or your economies will suffer. in the czech republic, china responded to plans by the mayor of prague to foster cooperation with taiwan by canceling a 14-city tour by the prague philharmonic orchestra scheduled for last fall and by blocking subsequent visits of several other cultural institutions based in the city. despite frequent threats, beijing has stopped short of imposing serious economic sanctions, in part because such a step against any individual eu nation would likely invite retaliation from the entire eu. so far, at least, china’s new bullying approach seems to be backfiring. that’s especially the case on the issue that currently matters most to beijing: whether to allow its huawei telecom giant to play a significant role in building europe’s 5g networks. the u.s. is lobbying hard to keep huawei’s cheaper equipment out of european networks. “huawei and other state-backed chinese companies are trojan horses for chinese intelligence,” secretary of state mike pompeo said in munich.  huawei insists that it is independent from the chinese communist party and last year sued french researchers who alleged otherwise. at the same time, however, china’s ambassador to berlin has issued implicit threats of targeting the german car industry if huawei is excluded. such chinese pressure ignited a rebellion against chancellor angela merkel’s relatively soft approach to huawei within her own cdu party. a cdu position paper published this month calls for limiting participation in 5g by “untrustworthy” suppliers that are beholden to a foreign state, and a cross-party alliance of government and opposition lawmakers now wants to ban companies like huawei from germany’s 5g system. the final 5g legislation is still being drafted. “it tells you something if official representatives of another state dare to interfere in a parliamentary process of legislation,” said norbert rottgen,  who heads the foreign-affairs committee in the german parliament and is running to succeed ms. merkel at the helm of the cdu. “this requires us to send a strong signal that we take our own decisions.” in france, the biggest mobile operator, orange, already announced in january that it won’t use huawei equipment. in italy, which became the first big western nation to join the belt and road initiative just last march, the mood on china has also soured, in part because of similar bullying attempts by beijing. in november, a handful of italian lawmakers decided to hold a videoconference with joshua wong,  a leader of the hong kong protesters. the chinese embassy in rome blasted the plan as a “grave error and irresponsible behavior” that “supports violence and crime.”  that attempt to scuttle a parliamentary event prompted all the main political parties as well as italy’s foreign ministry to condemn chinese meddling. days later, the italian parliament’s lower house unanimously passed a resolution supporting democratic freedoms in hong kong.  nowhere in europe is the backlash against china as strong as in sweden, however. according to pew, the number of people with a favorable opinion of china declined by 8 percentage points to 33% in france last year, by 11 points to 36% in the netherlands and by 5 points to 34% in germany. in sweden, the favorable rating of china sank to 25% in 2019 from 42% the year before. sweden’s troubles with china began in 2015, when a chinese-born swedish citizen, gui minhai, disappeared on a trip to thailand. a publisher once based in hong kong, mr. gui angered chinese authorities by writing about alleged corruption in the family of mr. xi and other subjects considered taboo in beijing. swedish officials say that mr. gui was kidnapped by chinese operatives. beijing says that the publisher turned himself in voluntarily to chinese police to stand trial for a 2003 drunken-driving episode that resulted in the death of a young woman and, after his release two years later, was rearrested for “illegally providing state secrets and intelligence.” the controversy turned into a crisis last november when sweden’s pen center drew attention to mr. gui’s plight by awarding him the prestigious tucholsky literary prize, which is usually delivered by the country’s culture minister. the decision drew a livid response from china’s ambassador to stockholm, gui congyou, whose outbursts have made him a household name in the country. “normal exchanges and cooperation will be seriously hindered,” especially if swedish officials attended the ceremony, he warned. “some people in sweden shouldn’t feel at ease after hurting the feelings of the chinese people.” sweden’s government ignored the warning and the culture minister delivered the prize anyway, at a ceremony where an empty chair was left for the jailed publisher. on tuesday, a court in china’s ningbo city said that mr. gui has been sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. such brushes with an increasingly intolerant, and self-confident, new china offer a sobering lesson to all western democracies, according to jesper bengtsson, the chairman of the swedish pen center. “we always used to talk about the spread of democracy and universal values, and about how we can affect change in countries like china from a position of strength,” mr. bengtsson said. “we now realize that we are not necessarily the strong party here. there has been a shift of power in the world.”  write to yaroslav trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com\n",
            " beijing—huawei technologies co. unveiled a chipset for its coming folding smartphone and other 5g devices, as the chinese giant pushes to be a global leader in the next-generation technology despite a growing backlash from western governments. with its balong 5000, huawei joins companies such as               qualcomm inc.         and               intel corp.         in announcing a 5g-compatible chipset. the components will form a pillar of 5g cellular networks, whose rollout in coming years is expected to bring faster speeds and a boom in internet-connected applications from self-driving cars to virtual reality. copyright ©2019 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8 huawei is the largest manufacturer of network infrastructure, such as base stations, and also a major maker of mobile devices like smartphones, of which it is the no. 2 vendor world-wide. its chipsets are used almost exclusively in huawei devices.         richard yu,  the head of its consumer-device business, brushed off the mounting political pushback against huawei from western countries.  “our customers have a lot of trust in us,” mr. yu said thursday at huawei’s research and development campus on the fringe of beijing. “in this complicated political environment, we can still keep good growth.” huawei is racing against a stable of western companies to implement 5g networks around the world. earlier this week at the world economic forum at davos, switzerland, huawei deputy chairman ken hu said the company has already deployed 5g technology in 10 countries and expects the number to grow to 30 in the next 12 months. the company earlier said it has secured more than 30 5g commercial contracts and shipped more than 25,000 5g base stations world-wide. while most are likely in china, said handel jones,  ceo of international business strategies, “huawei is 12 to 18 months ahead of the european companies in establishing base stations for commercial use.” as it presses ahead, huawei is embroiled in legal and political fights, including over the arrest last month of the company’s cfo in canada on charges related to alleged evasion of u.s. sanctions on iran. the company is also facing a u.s. criminal probe over allegations it stole secrets from u.s. business partners, and polish authorities have arrested a former huawei sales director on espionage charges. the chinese company is effectively barred from installing telecommunications equipment in the u.s., which is concerned the equipment could be used to spy on americans. huawei has forcefully denied this. still, u.s. allies including australia and new zealand have more recently restricted huawei’s role in their 5g networks. at davos, huawei chairman liang hua challenged its detractors to offer evidence that it is a threat. earlier this month, huawei’s founder and ceo, ren zhengfei,  said the company has never spied for the chinese government and never would. huawei has long maintained that it is owned by its employees and independent of beijing. on thursday, mr. yu said huawei plans unveil its next 5g smartphone, its first foldable model, at the next month’s mobile world congress in barcelona. it could go on sale to consumers as early as march or april this year, he added. the balong 5000 chipset, which mr. yu called “more than half a year ahead, maybe three quarters of a year ahead” of competitors’, will power 5g capability in huawei’s smartphones as well as other internet-connected devices, he said. san diego-based qualcomm last year launched a 5g modem, the snapdragon x50, though the two companies don’t compete directly in this market because unlike qualcomm, huawei sells almost none of its chipsets to outside vendors. huawei has been pouring resources into its in-house chip offerings. in the past few months, huawei—which invested more than $13 billion in research and development in 2017, the most of any chinese company—has also launch an ai-focused chipset as well as a chipset for servers based on semiconductor architecture from arm holdings. huawei in recent years has extended its lead in the market for telecommunications equipment, where it competes with sweden’s               ericsson         ab and finland’s               nokia corp.         to build base stations, routers and other cellular gear that form the backbone of wireless networks. the company expects to report a 21% increase in revenue for last year, to $108.5 billion. mr. yu said thursday revenue from consumer products exceeded $52 billion, making it the largest contributor of huawei’s main business lines.  write to dan strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com\n",
            " china’s vice president wang qishan delivered a thinly veiled rebuttal of u.s. attacks on its technology companies and policies at the world economic forum’s annual meeting wednesday.  copyright ©2019 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8 “it is imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony,” mr. wang said in a speech in davos, switzerland. he condemned “conducting, shielding or protecting technology-enabled activities that undermine other countries’ national security.” mr. wang didn’t specify what activities he was referring to, but the remarks appeared to be a response to escalating u.s. pressure against china and its technology companies, notably huawei technologies co.         the u.s. has discouraged the use of chinese-made equipment, in particular huawei’s, in u.s. telecommunications networks and pressed other countries to do the same. it is seeking the extradition of a top huawei executive from canada on allegations of violating sanctions against iran. forced transfer of technology to chinese competitors is a central u.s. complaint in the countries’ current trade negotiations.  china denies it forces foreign companies to transfer their technology, and huawei says its equipment isn’t used by the chinese government to spy on its customers. “we need to respect the independent choices of model of technology management and of public policies made by countries, and their right to participating in the global technological governance system as equals,” mr. wang said. over recent decades, companies have spread their activities and associated jobs across an increasing number of countries, a process known as globalization that relies on the free flow of goods, capital and, to a lesser extent, people across national borders. but voters in a number of developed economies have in recent years elected leaders openly hostile to those flows and globalization, leading to a recent rise in tariffs and other barriers to trade. mr. wang didn’t mention the u.s. in his speech, but his comments come as the two countries seek ways to resolve a trade dispute that was initiated by u.s. president trump,  who cites china’s large trade surplus as evidence that the existing relationship is unfair. answering questions following his speech, mr. wang said the confrontation between china and the u.s. harms both nations.  “for the chinese and u.s. economies, i believe they are in a state of mutual indispensability,” he said. “there has to be mutual benefit and win-win.” in his speech, mr. wang also said governments should counter a rising backlash against globalization by reducing income inequality at home rather than seeking scapegoats abroad. he said that protectionism and populism were on the rise, and they pose serious challenges to globalization. he said widening gaps between rich and poor within countries helped explain the backlash, and called on governments to address their domestic problems rather than transferring blame onto others. “what we need to do is make the pie bigger while looking for ways to share it in a more equitable way,” he said. “the last thing we should do is to stop making the pie and just engage in a futile debate on how to divide it. shifting blame for one’s own problems onto others will not resolve the problems.”  write to paul hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com and greg ip at greg.ip@wsj.com\n",
            " in chapter three, 2019, the world is in sync again. this time, though, it’s slowing together, not speeding up. u.s. output, after rising by around 3% in 2018, is projected by many economists to slow in 2019 to closer to the 2% annual growth trend of its long expansion. china, stung by u.s. tariffs, is expected to slow too.  “the optimism that was in the air in 2018 has given way to a more pervasive sense of gloom,” says eswar prasad,  a senior fellow at the brookings institution. “this of course is driven by the two major economies, the u.s. and china.” of course, this is just a rough draft for chapter three. much depends on key decisions by different players in the drama. primary among them are u.s. president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping.  the u.s. and china are locked in talks to resolve u.s. complaints that china competes unfairly on the trade front. mr. trump wants mr. xi to open chinese markets to more u.s. imports, stop subsidizing state-owned enterprises and better protect u.s. intellectual property. china has been resistant, but slowing growth is putting pressure on mr. xi to compromise. mr. trump, who watches the stock market closely and sees it as an indicator of his own performance, knows a deal could lift investors’ spirits. in other words, both sides have strong incentives to finish a deal. but they also face big barriers. mr. trump has staked his economic agenda on winning major economic reforms in china. a list of demands includes 142 separate action items, by china’s estimate. but mr. xi has little interest in ceding the state’s primary role in running the world’s second-largest economy, or in scaling back his broader ambitions to transform china into an independent, high-tech economic power.  time is short. if no deal is reached by march 2, u.s. 10% tariffs on $200 billion of chinese goods rise to 25%. meanwhile, with growth slowing in china, mr. xi has an incentive to act to stimulate the economy. that could turn china into the tax cutter in 2019. but mr. xi faces constraints taking stimulative steps. many local governments are already stretched for revenue after years of spending on debt-driven projects. lower interest rates and pumped up lending by state banks could worsen the strains on already stretched property markets and indebted state-owned enterprises. a currency devaluation could threaten large capital outflows and the ire of mr. trump. \n",

            "there is nothing that the attendees at the world economic forum in davos like better than a news event that fits a narrative and confirms a prejudice. donald trump, the showman in the white house, has obliged. \n",
            "on monday mr trump announced emergency “safeguard” tariffs against imports of solar panels and washing machines, citing jobs being lost among american producers.\n",
            "the narrative is obvious: mr trump is following through on his promise to tear up the rule book and punish china for dumping cheap products on the american market, even at the risk of starting a trade war. that conclusion would, however, be mistaken. mr trump’s actions are foolish and counter-productive, to be sure. but they are neither wildly unusual nor, by themselves, desperately damaging. this particular decision says as much about the degree of destructive licence afforded by the us’s trade laws as it does about mr trump’s aggressive eccentricities.\n",
            "it is important to be accurate about the tariffs announced on monday. rather than being an arbitrary unilateral initiative, they employ an existing (if rarely used) provision in us trade law and largely follow advice from the independent official agency, the international trade commission. nor are they targeted against china: they affect imports from a range of countries. \n",
            "the duties on domestic washing machines, for example, will hurt mainly south korean exporters. and as “safeguards”, rather than anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties, they do not involve judgments about unfair pricing or subsidy by a foreign company or government.\n",
            "we have been here before, under the previous two presidents. in 2009, using a tool specific to china, barack obama put safeguard tariffs on tyres. in 2002 george w bush did the same more broadly to imports of steel. in both cases, critics howled that the sky was about to fall in. in both cases, the tariffs served a relatively short-term political goal of being seen to protect a particular domestic industry. neither presaged a general surge of protectionism, still less a global trade war.\n",
            "with regard to trade, mr trump is a far more reckless and misguided president than either mr obama or mr bush. he has the opportunity in the weeks and months ahead to create more serious damage, with separate investigations into alleged chinese abuses of intellectual property rights and into whether aluminium imports constitute a threat to national security. those could more readily be used as broader tools to punish individual trading partners for perceived misdemeanours and to protect whole swaths of domestic industry on bogus security grounds.\n",
            "still, it does need to be said that most of the administration’s actions on trade so far have remained in the realm of the wrong-headed rather than the absurd, and that there has been some degree of calibration in their use. the solar tariffs, for example, are set below the maximum level permitted, and their level will be reduced in coming years. there appears to be at least some recognition of the damage that will be done to the us’s big solar-installation industry by suddenly increasing the price of its inputs.\n",
            "what one should think of mr trump’s trade policy depends on one’s expectations. compared to previous administrations, it is seriously worrying. compared to the extraordinary rhetoric about across-the-board 45 per cent tariffs he articulated before his election, it is a blessed relief. the world trading system is not infinitely resilient. it can, however, absorb blows like the one mr trump dealt it this week.\n",

            "the trump administration and the republican-dominated congress have undermined a range of important global initiatives to fight corruption and improve governance; for example, the repudiation of regulation mandating payment transparency by oil and mining companies and the withdrawal from implementing the extractives industry transparency initiative.\n",
            "the vacuum created by this abdication of global leadership means that other countries are now on their own on these challenges. national leaders have a chance to exercise regional if not global leadership. east asia and latin america have experienced major corruption scandals recently. their economic prospects hinge crucially on good governance and corruption control. both regions have also shown signs of progress in governance.\n",
            "thanks to superior public policies and governance, including control of corruption, east asia grew much faster than latin america over the past half century — twice as fast or so, more than bridging an initial income gap of some 3:1. but it is not a given that these two middle-income regions will continue their divergent growth paths. either can seize the moment and prosper, or falter.\n",

            "higher incomes do not translate into improved governance; it is better governance that drives sustained growth. improving governance raises average incomes threefold over time. when governance slips, growth suffers and income inequality grows. while east asian growth is still high, it has softened and inequality has worsened, approaching the higher (yet declining) levels in latin america.\n",
            "each region has been shaken by corruption scandals. brazil has had lava jato (operation car wash) while malaysia was roiled by 1mdb and south korea suffered the choi-samsung debacle, which cost the presidents of the country and of the largest conglomerates their jobs.\n",
            "due to its exposure of an intricate web of bribery and illicit political financing extending to many other countries, lava jato has resulted in the stoppage of infrastructure investments in other countries in the region, and has affected policymaking and the polity: witness the political earthquakes that have seized the highest office in peru, for instance.\n",
            "latin america’s growth prospects are handicapped by the extent of state capture — the undue influence of elite corporates in shaping the state’s policies, laws and regulations. further, the region has larger gaps than east asia in government effectiveness.\n",
            "in comparison, east asia’s governance deficit is glaring in “voice and accountability” — the ability of citizens to freely organise and express themselves and hold their governments to account — while countries in latin america (with exceptions such as venezuela and cuba), are more advanced. latin america is also ahead in transparency; for instance, countries rich in natural resources are less opaque than most of their resource-rich peers in east asia.\n",
            "the east asian deficit on citizen voice and accountability often translates into ineffective anti-corruption strategies, where the demand side for accountability is suppressed. anti-corruption drives in china and vietnam have garnered headlines, but their top-down approach, focused on selective purges, fails to get to the roots of corruption and is often driven by the political agenda of those in power. (the same may be said of russia’s vladimir putin banning anti-corruption activist alexei navalny from running against him in the upcoming presidential election, or of the “princely purge” in saudi arabia.)\n",
            "here is the progress to build on. in east asia, taiwan does well in voice and accountability and in controlling corruption. indonesia, repressive and ranking extremely low in corruption control in the 1990s, has experienced much progress on voice and accountability and in graft reduction, as well as in transparency in natural resources. but more is needed, not least in ensuring that its corruption eradication commission, komisi pemberantasan korupsi, remains truly independent. \n",
            "a number of latin american countries, spurred by citizen pressure, have also moved forward on reforming governance, such as brazil. there, an increasingly independent judiciary responded to corruption with determination and initiatives such as plea bargaining. in chile, progress has come recently thanks to its inclusive and independent anti-corruption commission, which led to many far-reaching reforms enacted by the government. colombia has also improved in anti-corruption and transparency, including in the extractives sector. chile, costa rica and uruguay score well on control of corruption, similar to oecd countries, and ahead of greece and italy.\n",
            "the evidence points to a strongly positive association between voice and accountability on the one hand, and corruption control, on the other, as depicted below. latin america, which is in the midst of a mega-election cycle, can build on its strength in voice and accountability, making its politicians and governments accountable, demanding an independent judiciary and an end to impunity, and a move away from elite capture by corporate interests. with political openings in some countries in east asia, progress is possible regarding citizen voice and participation as well as in transparency, which are key to addressing corruption.\n",

            "emmerson mnangagwa, the man who recently ousted robert mugabe as president of zimbabwe after 37 years, will travel to davos this week to tell the global elite that his country is “open for business”. deeply compromised as he is by years as one of mr mugabe’s chief lieutenants, he deserves a hearing — but also a clear message that he will be judged by his actions, not his words.\n",
            "mr mnangagwa’s very appearance at davos is a sign of change. under mr mugabe, zimbabwe became a pariah state. it broke with the imf in 2001 after mounting a shambolic and violent campaign to seize white people’s land. it has been in arrears ever since, cutting itself off from international finance. mr mugabe retreated into sulky isolationism. the currency was immolated on a bonfire of hyperinflation. today, one of the most educated and entrepreneurial populations in africa finds itself with almost no prospect of work. many of zimbabwe’s most talented are making a success of it in south africa and further afield, forming a diaspora rich with experience and know-how.\n",
            "there are reasons to believe that, under mr mnangagwa, zimbabwe could draw a line under elements of this sorry tale. true, he spent 50 years by mr mugabe’s side and was the ruthless enforcer of his leader’s authoritarianism. mr mnangagwa’s early cabinet appointments, including key military figures from november’s “non-coup” coup, do not bode well. he should be appointing competent technocrats.\n",
            "still, mr mnangagwa shows signs of being less of an ideologue than mr mugabe. he is making the right noises about foreign investment, scrapping harmful “indigenisation” laws that were an excuse for state pillage and opening up the political system.\n",
            "to get things done, he will need multilateral finance and an end to sanctions. that makes crucial the international community’s response to the “new” zimbabwe. go too slow and mr mnangagwa may hunker down into zanu-pf’s old ways. go too fast and he will assume he can get away with the mere rhetoric of change.\n",
            "this year’s election will be a crucial test. mr mnangagwa has promised democracy will be “strengthened and respected”. he told the financial times that election monitors from the eu, the united nations and the commonwealth would be welcome. he should be held to his word, but will need to do more. he must allow the formation of an independent election commission and wipe the electoral lists of dead voters. he should also permit the diaspora to vote, even knowing they tilt towards the opposition.\n",
            "mr mnangagwa may be calculating that, even if the election is fair, he will be swept to victory on a tide of optimism and amid opposition disarray. that distinct possibility makes it all the more important for the west to prod zimbabwe in the right direction. in economic matters, that means slimming a bloated bureaucracy, establishing fair and transparent rules for investors and eschewing corruption.\n",
            "mr mnangagwa holds some cards. after years of watching one of africa’s most promising economies slide towards the abyss, the west will be inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. he will also be able to count on china, which had grown tired of mr mugabe. inevitably, zimbabwe’s new leader will play something of a cat-and-mouse game. yet like others who have inherited moribund systems at the dead-end of history — think south africa’s fw de klerk or china’s deng xiaoping — mr mnangagwa could be a transformative figure. the international community needs to play a cautiously supportive role to keep that possibility alive.\n",

            "years of government profligacy and the elite’s plundering of some prime economic assets have led to soaring indebtedness, fiscal imbalances and a chronic liquidity crisis. the international monetary fund estimates that zimbabwe’s foreign debt is $9.4bn, or 52 per cent of gross domestic product, and it is forecast to rise to more than $10bn this year. \n",
            "mr mnangagwa raised the prospect of returning to the two-year-old talks with multilateral institutions on debt relief. the so-called lima plan broke down after zimbabwe failed to press ahead with reforms and was unable to raise funds to meet its repayment pledges for arrears owed to the world bank and the african development bank.\n",

            "every year in davos, there is a lunch organised by the cbi at which the keynote speech is invariably given by one of the senior government ministers in town. the guest list includes the bosses of a good cross-section of ftse 100 companies as well as representatives of smaller but fast-growing firms. invites are extended to the media so it is not hard to find out what business leaders are thinking about.last thursday’s lunch was all about politics, with two topics dominating the conversation: where is the government going with brexit and what are the prospects of jeremy corbyn being prime minister by the time the next lunch is held in january 2019?the uk could sign up to all the eu’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which eu members agree tariffs on external states. freedom of movement would continue and the uk would keep paying into the brussels pot. we would continue to have unfettered access to eu trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money?would not have been fulfilled. this?is an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.britain could follow norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to brussels – but is outside the customs union. that combination would tie britain to eu regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. a “norway-minus” deal is more likely. that would see the uk leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. but britain would align its rules and regulations with brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. the uk would still be subject to eu rules.a comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to canada would help british traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. but there would be little on offer for the uk services industry. it is a bad outcome for financial services. such a deal would leave britain free to diverge from eu rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. it would leave britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. many in brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on theresa may’s direction so far.britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by world trade organization rules. tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the irish border issue severe. in the short term, british aircraft might be unable to fly to some european destinations. the uk would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. it may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.for those running uk plc, the two issues are linked. they see the government as riven by its brexit factions and drifting towards disaster. big business supports the conservative party and has real misgivings about labour’s plans for the economy, but is now far more interested in finding out what these would mean in practice. anybody interested could have found out by seeking out john mcdonnell, who made his davos debut this year with a call for a clampdown on tax havens, for nationalisation and for redistribution of wealth. the guest speaker at this year’s lunch was philip hammond, and business liked what it heard. while accepting (albeit grudgingly) that britain is going to leave the eu, the cbi and its member firms would prefer as little change to the status quo as possible.this is hammond’s position, too. the chancellor said there was something unique about the trade negotiations britain would have with the eu: normally discussions are about how to bring countries closer together but london and brussels were discussing what new barriers to trade they wanted to put in place. hammond said his aim was to move britain and the eu very modestly apart.this seemed clear enough, but it was the chancellor’s own view, not a statement of government policy. within half an hour of the chancellor ending a question and answer session at the cbi lunch, the prime minister walked on stage in the davos congress centre to deliver a keynote address.if the government really had decided to aim for as much of a no-change brexit as possible, this was the perfect opportunity to do so. instead, theresa may made one fleeting reference to the result of the referendum in a speech devoted to ways of maximising the benefits and minimising the risks of new technology.may then met donald trump for a 15-minute chat before flying back to britain. on landing, a downing street spokesman said the prime minister did not agree with her chancellor that brexit could happen with only very modest changes.the prime minister’s problem is that the bulk of the parliamentary conservative party is at odds with hammond. it wants the “clean brexit” proposed by liam halligan and gerard lyons in their book of the same name. this involves leaving the single market, leaving the customs union, offering the other 27 nations a deal to carry on trading on existing tariff-free terms but being willing to fall back on world trade organisation rules if necessary.this, though, doesn’t seem to be what may has in mind either. halligan and lyons first came up with their clean brexit idea a year ago, when they argued it was important to give businesses certainty so that they could prepare for the future. that is precisely what may has not provided, but the attempt to keep everybody happy has proved impossible. tory remainers think the economy will be damaged by leaving the single market and the customs union; tory brexiters think the prime minister secretly wants “bino” (brexit in name only); business is demanding clarity so it can plan ahead; and voters have picked up on the idea that the government is winging it.the cbi has suggested a possible compromise: the government should commit to leaving the single market but commit to a customs union with the eu, although not necessarily the existing one.staying in the single market would involve contributions to the eu budget and accepting free movement of labour, the two issues at the heart of the leave campaign in june 2016. whatever the views of its member companies, the cbi has accepted that brexit involves leaving the single market.but the employers’ group thinks membership of a customs union is a different matter. it says this would avoid the cost of putting up barriers, put paid to the idea of long queues of lorries at uk ports and provide a solution to the irish border question.membership of a customs union would mean that the uk would have to impose tariffs on non-eu goods and would not be at liberty to strike its own trade deals independently of brussels. but the cbi says this is a spreadsheet issue: the government should weigh up whether the freedom to cut trade deals with the us or china is worth putting up trade barriers with its biggest export market for.for a number of reasons, a brexit compromise now looks increasingly likely. the resilience of the economy means there is no prospect of a recession-induced second referendum. the government’s loss of its overall majority in last year’s election means it doesn’t have the votes for a clean or “hard brexit”. and the passing of time means that businesses are threatening not to take long-term investment decisions unless they get a clearer idea of where things are heading.a hard brexit would take britain out of the eu’s single market and customs union and ends its obligations to respect the four freedoms, make big eu budget payments and accept the jurisdiction of the ecj: what brexiters mean by “taking back control” of britain’s borders, laws and money. it would mean a return of trade tariffs, depending on what (if any) fta was agreed.?see our full brexit phrasebook.nothing may has said during her 18 months as prime minister suggests she is ready to compromise. but everything she has done suggests that a compromise is coming. in the context of the current film darkest hour, may would have the country believe that she is the hardline winston churchill rather than his rival lord halifax, who wanted to explore a negotiated peace. but a negotiated peace is all may can offer. she talks like churchill but acts like halifax. \n",

            " • ken chenault is moving to venture capital. \n",

            " health care stocks fell on news that amazon, berkshire hathaway and jpmorgan are partnering to form a venture to lower the health care costs of their employees. \n",
            " the e-commerce giant has so disrupted businesses from booksellers to grocers to department stores over its two decades as a public company that just the mere mention of it entering a new sector spooks investors. and with good reason. amazon could spend huge sums, and bear years of losses, to win customers with lower prices. \n",
            " but beyond that threat, there are some big questions looming over the initiative. \n",
            " 1) what is it? \n",
            " the venture will be an independent company that “is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.” that sounds liberating, and there is no reason to think it won’t be, but such visionary language would pack a bigger punch if it was accompanied by hard cash. the release did not give details about the initial investment in the venture. \n",
            " 2) how big will it really be? \n",
            " the effort focuses on the united states employees of jpmorgan chase, amazon and berkshire hathaway. together, the companies have nearly one million employees (a portion of those, though, are outside of the united states.) that’s a lot of employees but relatively small when compared with 157 million people who had employer health care plans at the end of 2016, according to the kaiser family foundation. would the venture be able to scale up? some experts are skeptical about that. ben gomes-casseres, a professor of international business at brandeis, wrote: “my bet is that jpmorgan and amazon’s employees have pretty good health coverage, with plans that rank among the richest that the industry has to offer. if so, will these lead users be anxious to find a more cost-effective model? will they even be willing to experiment with their coverage? and, beyond that – if they do develop a new approach, will it be helpful to the masses of employees at lesser companies, or, worse, the unemployed and uninsured?” \n",
            " 3) do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost? \n",
            " it’s not clear how much more expertise amazon, berkshire and jpmorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don’t exist in other sectors. berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. what is more, berkshire’s point man in the joint health care effort will be todd combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company. \n",
            " 4) if the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs? \n",
            " much depends on whether the effort can address the main reason that health care spending has gone up in the united states versus other countries. a recent upshot column showed how much of the rise is a result of more being done for patients during hospital stays and doctor visits, or that they are charged more for those services. one way to assess the brash new initiative from jeff bezos, warren buffett and jamie dimon is whether it does anything to address this dynamic. \n",

            " the three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. they said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort “free from profit-making incentives and constraints.” \n",
            " mr. buffett’s concern about rising health care costs is not new, nor is his use of “tapeworm” to describe them. mr. buffett’s statement tuesday echoes other recent comments he has made on the subject. he trotted out the tapeworm metaphor to describe rising medical costs during television interviews in 2010 and 2012, moneybeat’s ben eisen and erik holm point out. \n",
            " at berkshire’s annual meeting in may, he said: “medical costs are the tapeworm of american economic competitiveness.” \n",
            " in fact, mr. buffett use of the tapeworm metaphor to describe drags on the economy dates back more than three-and-a-half decades at least. \n",

            "with “capitalism in america” a towering figure of modern policymaking, former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan,  is giving it a shot. he and the economist’s adrian wooldridge have authored a sweeping tome that takes us from the founders to the election of donald trump. their work is an accessible overview of american business history, but also presents a case for capitalism.\n",
            "by alan greenspan & adrian wooldridge  penguin press, 486 pages, $35\n",
            "the book starts with a charming thought experiment: “imagine that a version of the world economic forum was held in davos in 1620.” (i envisioned sessions about the battle of the white mountain’s effect on long-term government debt, or what the little ice age meant for beaver-pelt prices.) messrs. greenspan and wooldridge daydream about a forum focused on the question: “who will dominate the world in the coming centuries?”\n",
            "many nations would have been candidates. china was by far the world’s largest economy. the ottomans seemed about to burst through vienna’s walls and smash into western europe. the dutch and english were beginning to rule the oceans, and france, europe’s largest economy, was emerging from the chaotic wars of religion and into the reliable hands of henry iv and cardinal richelieu. by contrast north america would have seemed, at least to the panjandrums at davos in 1620, like “an empty space on the map.” it had no prospects. yet the united states would eventually become “the world’s biggest economy,” one that still “dominates the industries that are inventing the future.”\n",
            "geography and natural resources help explain america’s success. in 1800 americans lived on the edge of an enormous continent, but the wealth of that continent was virtually unreachable. capitalism helped bridge the gap. messrs. greenspan and wooldridge highlight not only the well-known canal and railroad entrepreneurs who “added more than thirteen miles of track every day for forty years from 1870 onward,” but also the entrepreneurs of horseflesh, who “practiced horse eugenics with an enthusiasm that would have dazzled francis galton.” entrepreneurs of the soil, including eli whitney, cyrus mccormick and john deere,  ensured that ever-greater agricultural surpluses would fill the railroad cars and canal holds.\n",
            "above all, the authors celebrate america’s pragmatic human capital—those who built new technologies atop the ruins of old technologies. the book is replete with sketches of characters like samuel morse, thomas alva edison and henry ford. they emphasize organizational geniuses such as j.p. morgan, who assembled trusts and “twice saved the u.s. government from default.” alfred sloan enjoys the authors’ encomiums for promoting individual choice by giving “high-flying managers responsibility for operating” distinct general motors’ divisions, from cadillac to chevrolet, while holding the managers of each group “responsible for their overall performance.”\n",
            "the authors argue that our political institutions helped give birth to our capitalist economy. america’s “luckiest break” was that our country “was born in the age of the enlightenment,” they write. we were “conceived in a revolt against a mercantilist regime” and the constitution that went into effect in 1789 established a “unified common market with no internal tariffs.” the scottish enlightenment, with its profound skepticism about unchecked state power, infused our constitutional convention and helped create “a fledgling democratic society that set strict limits on what the majority could do.”\n",
            "the spirit of adam smith won a second victory after the civil war, the authors assert, when “a modern commercial nation” triumphed over a “system of coerced labor” that “rested on foundations of unfathomable cruelty.” during the progressive era, our capitalist institutions survived a “revolt against laissez-faire,” partially because the founders gave us an independent supreme court that “acted as a vigilant guardian of the rights of property and freedom of contract.” the great depression did generate an enormous shift, as “fdr inherited a highly decentralized political economy committed to flexible markets and transformed it into a washington-dominated political economy committed to demand management, national welfare programs, and compulsory collective bargaining.” yet despite those changes america enjoyed two economically magical decades after world war ii.\n",
            "this revisiting of america’s rise to greatness illustrates the power of unfettered capitalism, but many readers will be more interested in alan greenspan’s take on our own age, when pessimism is on the rise. some argue that shared economic prosperity began to unravel in the 1970s, when manufacturers stopped employing as many less-educated men. according to this view, the asset-market booms of the quarter century between 1982 and 2007 distracted america from ominous trends like wage stagnation and the upward march of male underemployment.\n",
            "messrs. greenspan and wooldridge push the more positive view of a reagan-era rebirth. despite president reagan’s “big failure” of “creating more national debt than all the presidents who preceded him,” they point to three big successes: “he broke the power of the unions,” he “built on gerald ford’s initiatives . . . to move the economy in a more pro-market direction” and he signed the tax reform act of 1986. these reforms and other public innovations helped elevate a “new generation of entrepreneurs,” from microsoft’s bill gates to starbucks’s howard schultz.\n",
            "yet for more than a decade younger americans have endured an economy that seems to be living in the past, taking better care of their parents’ generation than their own. that sour economic experience informs the enthusiasm for socialism among the young, and in the book’s penultimate chapter the authors finally address “america’s fading dynamism.” they broadly endorse the common “human capital” explanation for american economic weakness: “while the positive features of america’s education system have been eroded, the negative features have become more pronounced,” citing tests that rank american 15-year-olds at 17th in reading, 20th in science and 27th in math. is it reasonable for americans to expect to be richer than better-educated peers in south korea and germany?\n",
            "the authors’ believe the best explanation for american stagnation is “the growth of productivity-suppressing entitlements” including social security, medicare and medicaid. perhaps. i share their enthusiasm for reforming poorly designed entitlements, including raising the starting age for social security and medicare. but i am not confident that entitlement reform will radically boost the rate at which new businesses are formed, or bring back jobs for millions of nonworking prime-aged men.\n",
            "messrs. greenspan and wooldridge seem skeptical about the view that “the it revolution is disappointing compared with previous technology-driven revolutions.” in their view, “the it revolution provides a chance of extending to the service sector the sort of productivity gains that we are used to in the manufacturing sector.” true, but the it revolution also threatens to eliminate low-skill jobs in the service sector, just as previous revolutions eliminated less-skilled manufacturing jobs. this technological shifter offers almost as much peril as promise, unless a new class of entrepreneurs dreams up new ways of employing less-skilled labor.\n",
            "readers who already believe our future depends on a dynamic, free market will have their beliefs bolstered by “capitalism in america.” yet i suspect few millennial supporters of sen. sanders will read these pages, feel the scales drop from their eyes and suddenly believe that the answer is less government. such conversions will require a new set of entrepreneurial heroes, whose careers could help make the case for human freedom—even to those who think that social inclusion is a higher goal than economic growth.\n",

            "in both the solar and washing machine cases, the u.s. industry had earlier won protection from imports under more commonly used trade laws designed to offer protection against goods that are improperly subsidized, or “dumped”—sold unfairly below cost.\n",

            "the global liberal order is holding up better than many feared a year ago.\n",
            "in europe, right-wing populists lost elections to the establishment in the netherlands, austria and france. u.s. president donald trump has prioritized traditional conservative causes like tax cuts over protectionism.\n",
            "but globalists should not breathe easy. the nationalist insurgency is both growing and metamorphosing. it is not just eating away at relations between countries on issues such as free trade; it is also eroding the institutions and norms that prevail within countries.\n",
            "this is not a problem for the global economy yet, as a synchronized upswing drives growth and stock prices higher. but it’s a shadow over the future. populists sustained by legitimate grievances at the cultural and economic upheaval caused by globalization often govern by authoritarian or divisive means, undermining the stable, rules-based environment that businesses crave.\n",
            "two statistics illustrate the trend. the first is economic. protectionism usually retreats as economies improve, but last year it rose despite a broad-based global expansion. global trade alert, a switzerland-based trade-monitoring group, counted 642 government actions that hurt other countries last year, from american tariffs on air mattresses to chinese financial support for its cloud-computing industry. though below the record set in 2015, that’s still up 95% from 2010.\n",
            "the second is political: freedom retreated in 71 countries last year and advanced in only 35, according to freedom house, a nonprofit group that rates countries across a range of political and civil liberties. liberal democracy has been in retreat since 2006, the group has found, and in recent years the retreat has accelerated.\n",
            "more troubling, the u.s., long the world’s bedrock of economic and political liberalism, was a key contributor to both trends. it initiated 143 harmful trade actions last year, up 59% from 2016. and while it remains a free country, the level of freedom has been slipping for seven years and especially so last year because of evidence of foreign interference in its elections, reduced transparency and slipping ethical standards, according to freedom house.\n",
            "nationalism and populism are not intrinsically at odds with liberal democracy or free markets; they often nourish resistance to tyranny. at the same time, actual and aspiring authoritarians routinely turn to nationalism to gain and keep power. they portray opponents such as judges, journalists and opposition politicians as the tools of an outside enemy or use nationalism to rally supporters along ethnic and religious lines.\n",
            "this trend is perhaps starkest in eastern europe. nationalism helped free the soviet union’s satellites from communism nearly three decades ago. but in recent years governments of both hungary and poland have invoked nationalism to justify an inexorable erosion of democratic institutions.\n",
            "both face the threat of european union sanctions—poland for curbing the independence of the judiciary, hungary for threatening to close an independent university, and both for their treatment of refugees. both have responded with defiance and appeals to religious and ethnic solidarity.\n",
            "in poland, the ruling law and justice party claims the eu’s criticism is a pretext for forcing multiculturalism and more muslim immigrants on it. hungary’s leader, viktor orban, has called muslim refugees “poison” and a threat to europe’s christian identity.\n",
            "as fear of islam rallies nationalists in some countries, fealty to the faith has done the same in muslim countries. pakistan and indonesia are nominally democratic, but muslim activists in both are undermining the rights of non-muslims. last november, they forced the resignation of pakistan’s law minister for supposedly watering down the oath parliamentarians take affirming that muhammad was the final prophet. in indonesia, they triggered a criminal investigation of jakarta’s christian governor for allegedly insulting islam, and then engineered his ouster in elections last april.\n",
            "thus far, no established western democracy has seen any comparable erosion of institutions or minority rights, even those in the grips of nationalism. britons’ vote to leave the european union was both nationalist and unquestionably democratic. in its wake british political parties, including the separatist scottish national party, continue to reject xenophobia, with the exception of the uk independence party, which has receded into irrelevance since the brexit referendum.\n",
            "yet the pressure elsewhere is unmistakable. marine le pen,  who advocated leaving the euro and dramatically reducing immigration, lost to the globalist emmanuel macron in france’s presidential election but still led the national front to a record 34% share of the vote. in austria, the far-right freedom party, which staunchly opposes immigration and warns of “islamification,” won enough votes to be invited into the governing coalition, and in germany, the anti-muslim, anti-immigration, anti-euro alternative for germany won enough of the vote to deny chancellor angela merkel a ​conservative governing coalition. this has had an unmistakable effect on those countries’ policies, especially on immigration.\n",
            "as for the u.s., mr. trump has governed much like a traditional republican and earlier this month loudly split with his former strategist steve bannon, a fiery proponent of economic nationalism who once disparaged the pro-globalization political establishment as “the party of davos.” david french of the national review welcomed the demise of “incoherent, destructive nationalist-populist ideology” and a chance for the republican party to “restore itself as a party of conservative ideas.”\n",
            "but this is premature. mr. bannon may be gone, but mr. trump’s hostility to immigration and free trade persists. mr. trump’s administration is gearing up for a more aggressive assault this year on what it considers unfair trade, especially china’s.\n",
            "meanwhile, mr. trump has governed much as he campaigned: as the advocate for his political base, while attacking judges, journalists and politicians who oppose him as enemies of the country. he signaled solidarity with white and evangelical christian voters by defending confederate war monuments and endorsing the fundamentalist christian roy moore in the alabama senate special election despite accusations of sexual misconduct.\n",
            "thus far, the checks and balances of american democracy have survived. yet democracy itself is changing as partisan disagreements harden into tribal hatred. republican congressman mark sanford,  who was first elected in 1994 and served eight years as governor of south carolina, long saw religious and ethnic divides such as the islamic world’s shiite-sunni split as alien to the u.s. “republicans, democrats, southerners, northerners, blacks, whites, you’re [part of] an american-based system of beliefs, founded on reason and ideas,” he said in an interview. “what i see now is very troubling. it’s my group against your group. it’s more tribal than i’ve ever seen it.”\n",
            "some of his constituent meetings have become circuses of incivility. “if i say something considered even slightly anti-trump by pro-trumpers, you get acid poured on your head. if i say something viewed as pro-trump by ‘indivisible’ or the anti-trumpers, you get acid poured on your head. there’s just a no-man’s-land in between.”\n",
            "businesses’ first reaction to such stresses is to try to ignore them and focus on making money. economic research finds little correlation between democratic rule and economic growth, and the current global upswing, with exceptions such as venezuela, seems to prove the point.\n",
            "\n",
            "yet over time, political and economic freedom go hand in hand. as politics turns authoritarian or tribal, the laws and rules by which businesses operate become more capricious.\n",
            "in russia and china, corruption investigations have long been a pretext for punishing wayward business leaders. still, even by their authoritarian standards, economic freedom has become more circumscribed. china’s communist party has recently pressed to increase its representation within key companies while leading internet businesses partner with the government in spying on its people.\n",
            "in democratic systems, tribal politics makes for tribal policy, which can then change when a different tribe takes over. because barack obama’s health-care measures passed with no republican support, its survival has long been a question mark, leaving a cloud of uncertainty over the health-care system.\n",
            "now that republicans are in control, they have doubled down by passing a tax overhaul on party lines and saddling much of the cost on democratic-leaning states by limiting the deductibility of state and local taxes. new york’s democratic governor, andrew cuomo,  called it an act of “economic civil war.”\n",
            "mr. trump crafts policy interventions to the needs of his political base. he lambastes companies that move jobs out of the industrial states that were crucial in his presidential victory, and intervened to encourage the taiwanese contract manufacturer foxconn technology group to put a new flat-panel factory in wisconsin. some observers think the justice department is trying to block\n",

            "these are, for now, minor irritants in the scheme of things. history shows that populism and prosperity can coexist for a long time. yet to maintain the support of key groups, populists are constantly tempted to make extravagant promises the country cannot afford. mr. trump has delivered the tax cuts traditional republicans wanted, while standing firm against cutting back the entitlements his older, working-class supporters cherish.\n",
            "populism, says mr. sanford, is bad for business “because it’s unsustainable. the populism that says we’re not going to touch your social security or medicare is going to go looking for revenue to keep those promises.”\n",

            "tokyo—he was called a “space alien” or “cyborg” for his spock-like personality. as hiroto saikawa rose up through nissan motor co.’s nsany 1.87% ranks over four decades, he revealed so little of himself to colleagues that many weren’t even sure whether he was married.\n",
            "it hardly mattered because nissan’s longtime leader, carlos ghosn,  had enough star power for the entire executive team, traveling the globe from davos to detroit to deliver his message about nissan’s turnaround and his vision for cars of the future. at meetings, mr. saikawa would often parrot the boss and begin sentences with “mr. ghosn says,” according to people who worked with both men.\n",
            "then, on nov. 19, mr. ghosn was arrested for alleged financial crimes and the 65-year-old mr. saikawa, who has worked at nissan his entire adult life, was thrust suddenly into sole leadership of one of the world’s major auto makers.\n",
            "in 2019, mr. saikawa faces challenges that would tax even the most charismatic executives. he must restore morale at a divided company where some ghosn loyalists retain their positions, while repairing relations with nissan’s biggest shareholder, renault sa of france, which since mr. ghosn’s fall has been sending chilly signals to mr. saikawa about his handling of the crisis.\n",
            "nissan ceo hiroto saikawa has worked for the auto maker his entire adult life.\n",
            "he must also overcome the “brutus” label affixed to him by some critics who accuse mr. saikawa of orchestrating a coup against his former boss when his own job was threatened. people familiar with the probe of mr. ghosn for alleged financial crimes say that mr. saikawa wasn’t told until prosecutors had been pursuing the case for months.\n",
            "inside nissan, managers have witnessed the impact on mr. saikawa. at a late-night news conference on the day of mr. ghosn’s arrest, mr. saikawa made rare references to his own emotions, saying he felt confused and angry. days later, at a meeting with nissan managers about the arrest, mr. saikawa choked up at several points and was unable to continue speaking, according to a person who attended.\n",
            "nissan declined to make mr. saikawa available for comment.\n",
            "the lives of the two executives—who are just four months apart in age—first crossed paths in 1999 when nissan was facing potential bankruptcy. mr. ghosn came to japan to lead renault’s bailout of nissan, and soon he was leaning on mr. saikawa, an english-speaking graduate of the elite university of tokyo who was ready to put in long hours to help mr. ghosn carry out radical change.\n",
            "mr. saikawa helped oversee joint purchasing of parts between nissan and renault. the purchasing department is considered a proving ground for nissan employees because cost-cutting is an overriding concern in the auto industry. mr. saikawa’s success at cutting costs got him a promotion in 2007 to head operations in the u.s., the source of most of nissan profits. in 2009, mr. saikawa was put in charge of asia, which included china operations, where nissan is betting for growth.\n",
            "his style was unorthodox for a japanese executive with ambitions for the top. he would rarely attend group dinners or go out for drinks, the norm in many japanese companies, according to people who worked with him. one said he drew a sharp line between business and personal meals. few colleagues knew that he has a wife and three children, now grown.\n",
            "“you don’t know what he’s thinking,” said a person who worked alongside mr. saikawa for years.\n",
            "instead of office conviviality, he preferred socializing at parties he hosted at home, to which few nissan colleagues received invitations. a nissan executive who attended one such gathering said mr. saikawa was a different person there, pouring drinks and joking. this person says mr. saikawa enjoys walking his dog.\n",
            "at the office, mr. saikawa was a stern enforcer of mr. ghosn’s plans, people who worked with him recall. he was known to lash out during meetings at those he thought were underperforming—a trait mr. ghosn shared—but was much calmer one-on-one, willing to listen sympathetically, some of the people said.\n",
            "in 2013, mr. saikawa became chief competitive officer, making him the number two executive at nissan. he took a co-ceo role with mr. ghosn in 2016 and, in april 2017, finally became ceo on his own as mr. ghosn stepped back from nissan to focus on the alliance with renault, where he remains ceo.\n",
            "even after reaching the top, mr. saikawa remained in mr. ghosn’s shadow. in japan, companies often hold an inaugural press conference for new chiefs at which they share details about family and hobbies, grist for profiles in the next morning’s papers. mr. saikawa avoided that. in a 2017 interview, he called mr. ghosn a “charismatic hero” who rescued the company, saying he hoped to emulate mr. ghosn’s management style.\n",
            "but over the next 18 months, differences between the two began to emerge. mr. ghosn was fond of specific numerical targets, believing they were easy to understand and helped focus workers. mr. saikawa has said he wishes to avoid hard targets, favoring more broadly defined goals of improved profitability.\n",
            "investors saw mr. saikawa as a natural successor to mr. ghosn, but thought his tenure would be limited to assisting in preparing the alliance for mr. ghosn’s retirement. recently, they have called into question his leadership after an overzealous effort to slash costs in the u.s. in april caused sales to crater.\n",
            "and some within nissan resented mr. ghosn for letting mr. saikawa take all the heat for quality scandals at nissan plants in japan that began late last year, even though the problems dated to mr. ghosn’s time as ceo.\n",
            "by the fall of 2018, each man was harboring a secret. mr. ghosn was maneuvering to oust mr. saikawa, according to people with knowledge of the matter, believing mr. saikawa had botched a turnaround of the u.s. business and failed to stem quality-related issues at nissan’s japanese factories.\n",
            "mr. saikawa, meanwhile, learned in october of a secret internal investigation led by a handful of nissan executives, say people familiar with probe. mr. saikawa’s initial reaction to the findings was disbelief, said one person who was present when he was briefed on them. mr. saikawa immediately formed a formal investigation team to examine the accusations independently. roughly a month and a half later, nissan helped coordinate mr. ghosn’s arrest by tokyo prosecutors.\n",
            "since then, mr. saikawa has gone from being one of mr. ghosn’s most ardent public advocates to a vocal critic. mr. saikawa has said mr. ghosn was too powerful and his long tenure led to insufficient oversight of his actions.\n",
            "the sudden reversal in mr. saikawa’s view of his former boss has led to accusations of betrayal by allies of mr. ghosn and greg kelly,  the former nissan representative director arrested with him. mr. kelly’s wife, dee, said in a video released shortly before christmas that mr. saikawa and others at nissan had “dishonorable motives” and were “behind this scheme to frame greg.”\n",
            "rejecting charges that he had carried out a coup, mr. saikawa said, “this is about eliminating significant misconduct.”\n",
            "messrs. ghosn and kelly were charged on dec. 10 with understating mr. ghosn’s compensation on nissan financial statements. his lawyer has said mr. ghosn denies wrongdoing, and mr. kelly has said he is innocent.\n",
            "there are early signs that mr. saikawa is successfully rallying the troops. at a large meeting a week after mr. ghosn’s arrest, mr. saikawa laid out mistakes he believed mr. ghosn had made and his proposed improvements in governance. nissan employees, according to people who heard the talk, broke into applause when mr. saikawa had finished.\n",

            "canberra is poised to stymie a deal under which huawei was to run a seabed cable more than 4,000km from sydney to the solomon islands, instead bankrolling the a$100m (us$78m) project itself.\n",
            "“the huawei deal was red-flagged by the australian intelligence service,” says jonathan pryke, analyst at the lowy institute think-tank. “the new national security imperative has clearly jolted australia into action.”\n",
            "australia had already signalled privately that it would not grant landing rights for huawei’s project. but its offer to fund the cable, which will transform the solomon islands’ internet connectivity and include an extension to papua new guinea, shows the growing battle between beijing and canberra for influence and control of critical infrastructure in the south pacific.\n",
            "a solomon islands spokesman told the financial times that an australian scoping team recently visited the country, which was showing “great interest” in the offer to use development aid to co-finance the cable.\n",
            "“naturally, if the solomon islands government accepts the offer from australia then no doubt the huawei deal will have to be cancelled,” he said.\n",
            "submarine cables are vital to global communications, carrying about 97 per cent of international internet traffic, which includes emails as well as financial transfers worth $10tn every day. but there are concerns among western defence experts that huawei and certain other chinese tech groups, which they claim have links to the chinese communist party, could be directed by beijing to use their influence within the submarine cable industry to exert pressure on nation states or engage in espionage.\n",
            "analysts point to the example of vietnam, where in 2014 chinese investors froze financing for infrastructure projects following hanoi’s criticism of beijing over its south china sea island building. last year screens at vietnam’s two biggest airports were hacked to show messages criticising hanoi’s stance on the issue, an attack that demonstrated the vulnerability of a country with chinese-built digital infrastructure to cyber attack from chinese sources, according to a report by researchers at the university of washington. \n",
            "“ownership in the undersea cable system, as well as leverage over its installation and maintenance, presents significant strategic opportunities for the people’s republic of china,” says robert “jake” bebber, an information warfare officer at us cyber command.\n",
            "he warns that control over undersea cables could enable beijing to access nearly all communications traffic worldwide, including that of the us military. mr bebber says it could enable china to disrupt communications at a time and place of its choosing.\n",
            "huawei has in the past denied any history of spying or connection to the chinese communist party. ren zhengfei, the company’s reclusive chairman who worked in the information technology research unit of the chinese army until 1982, told an audience in davos in 2015 that “we have never been asked by our government to spy”.\n",
            "huawei’s marine networks division is a joint venture with global marine systems, a uk company with more than 150 years experience in installing and maintaining communications systems. \n",
            "gms defended its operations with huawei, which it said was “trusted by operators, enterprises and consumers in more than 170 countries”.\n",
            "established in 2008, the division has secured contracts on almost every continent against the traditionally dominant players in the industry — france-based alcatel-lucent and swiss-owned te connectivity. but it has been particularly successful in asia, the pacific and africa, which are fuelling a boom in the undersea cable market, which more than doubled to $1bn in 2016, up from $400m in 2014, according to the consultancy ovum.\n",
            "huawei’s success has prompted claims from rivals that it benefits from subsidies from beijing, which have enabled it to hoover up contracts by selling below cost. the group has also faced questions over the incentives it is willing to offer customers to win contracts.\n",
            "a report by the solomon islands parliamentary accounts committee called for a police inquiry into a si$40m (us$5m) political donation allegedly paid by huawei to the party of then prime minister manasseh sogavare. huawei strongly denies the allegation.\n",
            "“these allegations have no basis in fact. huawei has never given, implied, nor promised any political donations in relation to this project,” said a company spokesman.\n",
            "“cyber security remains a top priority at huawei. we incorporate strict security protection into all of our business processes, and remain open to working with governments and industries to address global cyber security challenges together,” he added. \n",
            "huawei has been blacklisted from bidding for certain state contracts in the us and australia following concerns expressed by security agencies of both countries. this followed an investigation by the us house of representatives in 2012, which concluded that chinese groups huawei and zte “cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the united states and to our systems”. \n",
            "other western countries, including the uk and new zealand, have warmly welcomed investment by huawei. the company works closely with bt, supplying the uk company with infrastructure for its nationwide broadband network.\n",
            "in 2012 huawei pledged to invest $2bn in the british economy. in a bid to alleviate concerns expressed by security experts and mps, it set up the huawei cyber security evaluation centre in oxfordshire to evaluate equipment to ensure it does not present a security risk to the uk. the centre is overseen by an independent board chaired by the cyber security chief of gchq, the uk intelligence body.\n",
            "“we can confirm that we have never been asked to provide access to our technology, or provide any data or information on any citizen or organisation to any government or their agencies,” a huawei spokesman told the ft.\n",
            "but in the us and australia, where concerns over china’s growing influence in the indo-pacific region are rising, huawei’s success is not celebrated by the security establishment.\n",
            "“chinese telecoms companies have connections to the chinese state,” says peter jennings, executive director of the australian strategic policy institute. “this raises the risk of infiltration, intellectual property theft and could give beijing the capacity to shut down australian networks in the event of a crisis.”\n",

            "several us presidents have proclaimed a new world order. today most of us remember only the one that george hw bush called for at the end of the cold war. “that new world order is struggling to be born — a world quite different to the one we’ve known,” said bush senior in 1990. minus the soviet union, it was in fact roughly the same one we had known for the previous half-century. with a few ups and downs, pax americana held for about another decade. \n",
            "since the attacks of 9/11, however, the fissures have begun to show. in the past few months, it has become possible to imagine a crack-up. for obvious reasons, not even donald trump would dream of boasting about ushering in a new world disorder. yet bush’s words may inadvertently have foreshadowed what is happening today. “america has always led by example,” he said. “so, who among us will set the example? which of our citizens will lead us in this next american century?” he could not possibly have guessed the answer to that. \n",
            "history, as they say, is lived forwards but written backwards. two decades before bush senior’s declaration, dean acheson, the former us secretary of state, wrote his classic, present at the creation. it set out in epochal detail how america had created the postwar system that bush rebranded the new world order. bodies that today seem to be in the natural scheme of things — the united nations, nato, the international monetary fund and the forerunner to the world trade organization — were assembled against the odds by the truman administration in which acheson served. it was a unique historical flurry of global institution-building that could only have been undertaken by america. no other country had the self-belief — or wherewithal — to remake the world in its own image. \n",
            "today, in the era of donald trump, it feels as though we may be living history backwards. america has a president who disdains his country’s handiwork. for most of the past seven decades, it was america’s enemies, led by the soviet union, that attacked the liberal order. much of the world saw the un security council and other bodies as neo-imperial instruments of us power. every now and then, us presidents complained that others were not paying sufficient dues. none ever questioned their existence. america’s detractors could carp at the global order secure in the knowledge that it wasn’t in any danger. since january 20, that assumption no longer feels safe. “we forget how unnatural the us-created liberal world order always was,” says robert kagan, a trenchant conservative critic of trump. “it is hard to imagine who will sustain it when the us president himself is actively undermining it.” \n",
            "in one way or another, all of america’s closest allies are now wrestling with that quandary. even those who have traditionally been reluctant to voice their misgivings in public are speaking out. last month, angela merkel said it was time for germany and europe to take their “fate into their own hands”. she said this shortly after trump had declined to offer his support for nato’s article 5 mutual defence clause, despite his recent unveiling of a plaque to the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the only time america’s allies had invoked the clause. “the times in which we could rely on others — they are somewhat over,” said merkel with her trademark understatement. \n",
            "earlier this month, chrystia freeland, canada’s foreign minister, gave a speech in which she asked what canada should do in a world in which the us was no longer reliable. thanking america for decades of global leadership, freeland (a former colleague at the financial times), said it was time to act as though that age was passing. “the fact that our friend and ally has come to question the very worth of its mantle of global leadership puts into sharper focus the need for the rest of us to set our own clear and sovereign course,” freeland told canada’s house of commons. \n",
            "her speech elicited no reaction from the trump administration. plenty of other us figures approved of what she said. “if i were advising on national security in any other country, i would be asking exactly the same questions,” said richard haass, head of the council on foreign relations and a former senior official in several republican administrations. “something fundamental seems to be breaking. if america can do it once [under trump], why can’t it happen again?” \n",
            "then there are america’s potential adversaries, chief among them china and russia, who are a bit like the proverbial dog that caught the car. having railed against the so-called “unipolar moment” that followed the cold war, they find it has ended far quicker than they expected. for both china and russia, trump’s presidency is an unimagined geopolitical windfall. \n",
            "***\n",
            "the response from trump’s shrinking circle of apologists is to point to the acknowledged “globalists” he has put in the biggest roles. the shorthand for these is “mmt” — james mattis, us secretary of defence, hr mcmaster, national security adviser, and rex tillerson, secretary of state. this so-called “axis of adults” will keep trump honest, they say, and prevent him from taking steps to detonate the global order. there are two glaring problems with this panglossian account. the first is that trump keeps ignoring their advice. his decision to undercut nato last month reportedly caught most of his advisers by surprise. the fact that he casually uttered that missing nato pledge a few days later was only mildly reassuring. he has done so before, only to reverse himself. “when trump says the right thing, it’s like one of those snapchat images,” says the washington ambassador of a us ally. “it seems to vanish straight after you’ve seen it.” \n",
            "trump also spurned mmt’s unanimous counsel not to pull out of the paris agreement on global warming. the same willingness to overrule those around him is evident in trump’s loud support for the persian gulf states’ decision to sever ties with qatar — a measure just short of war — even though qatar plays host to 11,000 us troops. while tillerson was trying to mediate, trump was goading the saudis and its allies to go further. whom should the world take seriously? tillerson or trump? “i don’t buy this theory about the axis of adults,” says kagan. “even obama was able to overrule his senior generals. we have no evidence to show that the so-called adults can stop trump from being trump.”\n",
            "the second drawback is that trump’s world view is deeply at odds with most of his senior officials (stephen bannon, the anti-globalist white house chief strategist, is the big exception). for more than 40 years, trump has consistently seen the rest of the world as a hostile place — foes and allies alike. phrases such as “they are laughing at us” and “we are being ripped off” have tripped off his tongue since the 1980s. at 71, it seems unlikely he will change his instincts. on his first trip abroad last month, trump again berated germany for paying less than its fair share to nato, and for its alleged cheating on trade. “trump believes all foreigners are playing us for suckers — he sees the world as a dark place,” says ivo daalder, a former us ambassador to nato. “how can you lead alliances when you keep telling your allies they are ripping you off?” \n",
            "some insist trump is a “realist” — a refreshing contrast to the neoconservatives around george w bush. but such an approach only works with a nuanced grasp of what motivates other countries. trump makes no effort to seek out their opinion. america’s allies were particularly shocked last month when hr mcmaster and gary cohn, the president’s senior economic adviser, wrote a wall street journal column setting out trump’s diplomatic principles. “the world is not a ‘global community’ but an arena where nations, non-governmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage,” they wrote. “rather than deny this elemental nature of international affairs, we embrace it.” \n",
            "it is striking how often european leaders and china seem to agree with each other nowadays\n",
            "so much for realism. what mcmaster and cohn depicted was a brutalist world in which there were no shared values. the fact that it was a carefully penned message delivered by two of trump’s more seasoned advisers, rather than a casual tweet by the president himself, was particularly striking. “these are the people who are supposed to be moderating trump,” says one european diplomat. “the message we took was, ‘you’re on your own now.’” \n",
            "an added complication is that it is by no means clear trump’s top three cabinet officials even agree with each other. mattis and mcmaster are widely rumoured not to get along, while tillerson’s world view is still largely unknown. of the three, outsiders place most faith in mattis, who has found it increasingly hard to justify trump’s stances in public. “it would be a big surprise to me if mattis is still in his job a year or two from now,” says javier solana, the former top diplomatic envoy for the eu. \n",
            "trump’s next big test will come in early july when for the first time he will meet his russian counterpart, vladimir putin, at the g20 summit in hamburg, germany. the visual takeaways from such confabulations often speak louder than the statements. at the g20 in australia in november 2014, shortly after russia had annexed crimea, putin was photographed alone, shunned by his fellow leaders. he left the meeting early. his departure symbolised russia’s isolation. trump’s decision to take a golf cart rather than join the other six leaders on foot at the g7 summit in taormina, sicily, last month also spoke volumes, prefiguring his withdrawal from the paris agreement a few days later. “he could not even be bothered to walk for a few minutes with his fellow leaders,” says solana. “it said so much about him.” \n",
            "will trump be pictured chatting happily with putin in hamburg? or will he be alone? “the more trump emphasises america first, the more it turns into america alone,” says daalder. those who know putin say he will use the meeting to do a forensic probe of trump’s strengths and weaknesses. how the former kgb officer reads the us president will shape russia’s actions in the coming months.\n",

            "but the highest-stakes trump mind-reading is taking place in china. russia may present an immediate threat to america’s allies in europe. beijing poses the transcendent challenge. those who made the case that trump was “normalising” pointed to his meeting in april with xi jinping, china’s president, at mar-a-lago. in contrast to the election campaign, in which he accused china of “raping” america, trump struck a convivial tone at this first meeting with his chinese counterpart and discarded all talk of launching a trade war. in exchange he enlisted xi’s help in supposedly rolling back north korea’s nuclear programme. in practice, china has done little more than it was already doing — not very much — to rein in north korea’s kim jong un. but xi’s charm offensive was well judged. \n",
            "not only did he travel to trump’s florida club, which is where the us president feels most at home but china also approved dozens of pending trump trademarks. his visit also coincided with a flurry of approvals for ivanka trump’s line of accessories. xi, in other words, came bearing gifts for the president and his family. kagan describes this as “bringing fruits to the volcano”. it worked. trump duly sang xi’s praises — and has done so ever since. \n",
            "others of whom trump has spoken glowingly include the leaders of saudi arabia, russia, egypt, turkey and the philippines. barring the last, which is run by the pugilistic rodrigo duterte, each is an autocracy. trump rarely has a good word to say about his fellow democratically elected leaders. \n",
            "it is not only canada and germany that are seeking insurance against a wayward us. others re-evaluating their place in the world include france, australia and mexico. meanwhile, the clutch of smaller allies that play host to us military bases, such as singapore and djibouti, will be watching qatar’s fate with interest. does hosting us troops buy you any loyalty in washington? “in every interaction with a foreign power, especially an ally, you have a us president asking: ‘what’s in it for us?’” says haass. “it is only natural that allies will follow suit and drift into japan first, france first, canada first — and so on.” \n",
            "long before trump’s victory, australians were also debating whether their country should distance itself from the us to accommodate a rising china — a more important economic partner than the us. now such arguments have gone mainstream. former prime ministers, such as paul keating, make the case that australia should hedge its bets. “the ‘equidistance’ argument used to be made on the fringes of academia and the media,” says andrew shearer, who was national security adviser to tony abbott, australia’s last prime minister. “trump has made their case so much more respectable.” \n",
            "meanwhile, the uk, which is likely to be absorbed in brexit deliberations for years to come, is no longer an active player. america’s circle of reliable allies is dwindling. even before brexit, the uk was scaling back. the british army is now smaller than the us marine corps. “for the foreseeable future, the us-uk special relationship is irrelevant,” says thomas wright, a brookings scholar of foreign policy. “britain has decided to remove itself completely from the chessboard.” \n",
            "america’s friends would be more sanguine about the health of the world order if they saw trump as an aberration. but he is more of a symptom — albeit an alarming one — than a cause of america’s retreat from its postwar role. with some reason, us leaders have for years beseeched their allies to spend more on defence. to little avail. since the end of the cold war, it has become ever harder for us leaders to convince voters of the old kennedy exhortation to “pay any price, bear any burden”. the very notion that an aspiring us president could urge americans to sacrifice on behalf of other countries seems fanciful. perhaps they are on to something. if the world order collapsed, americans would probably be the last to feel it. “we would pay the lowest price,” says kagan. \n",
            "in reality, america’s global retrenchment began to really take hold under barack obama — albeit in a highly different style to trump. it was during obama’s second term that china overtook the us as the world’s largest economy on a purchasing power parity basis. it is likely to overtake the us in dollar terms within the next presidential term, regardless of who is in office. \n",
            "the world was already making adjustments before trump announced his candidacy. almost two years before the uk’s brexit referendum, david cameron, britain’s then prime minister, rolled out the red carpet for xi jinping on a state visit to the uk. britain also enraged obama’s white house by rushing to join china’s asia infrastructure investment bank, which was set up as an explicit rival to the us-created bretton woods system. others, such as australia and germany, hesitated but then followed suit. almost every western power sent delegations, among them 29 heads of state, to china’s recent “one belt, one road” summit in beijing. when china speaks, foreign governments listen. when trump tweets, they find a senior us official to check whether he really meant it. “you could ask whether the uk was an outlier, or whether it was an early adopter,” says wright. “it is not yet clear which.”\n",
            "the big imponderable is whether trump will inflict irreparable damage on the world order before he leaves office. he has been in power for just over 150 days, which is barely 10 per cent of his allotted first term. the world could respond in two different ways. the troubling scenario is that we are indeed present at the early stages of the destruction. one of the reasons xi played nice with trump in april was to keep things calm until the next communist party congress, which takes place in september. once xi has cemented his hold on the presidency for another five years, he will be freer to pursue his foreign policy goals. chief among these is consolidating china’s control of the disputed south china sea islands. taiwan is also in xi’s sights. “it is a fair bet that us-china relations will get a lot more testy after september,” says wright. “next year is likely to be a year of us-china tensions.” \n",
            "it is an open secret that china now has the capacity to threaten america’s battle groups with its anti-ship missiles and submarines, which means the us can no longer intimidate in the way it once did. indeed, some see the aircraft carriers as sitting ducks. the scope for accident, and miscalculation, is high. will xi call trump’s bluff? does he, like putin, see trump as a paper tiger? worse, could they misread trump as a paper tiger when in fact he would prove trigger-happy in a showdown? there is no way of telling. therein lies the rub. in his book, acheson set out how a global leader should above all be predictable and uphold the rules. whatever happens during trump’s watch, we can be sure those precepts are off the table. \n",
            "the rosier path is one in which other nations step into the breach vacated by trump’s america: the rest of the world, in other words, might finally take ownership of acheson’s creation. the strongest sign of that came from xi in january, when he told the davos gathering of global elites that china was prepared to uphold the world economic order in the teeth of us protectionist rhetoric. “some people blame economic globalisation for the chaos in our world,” said xi. “we should not retreat into a harbour whenever we encounter a storm; otherwise we will never reach the other side.” \n",
            "likewise, china and india showed restraint in response to trump’s decision to quit the paris deal last month. both li keqiang, china’s prime minister, and narendra modi, india’s prime minister, visited european capitals in the same week and agreed with eu counterparts that they would stick to their paris carbon pledges. “it is striking how often european leaders and china seem to agree with each other nowadays,” says solana. \n",
            "another hopeful sign is the warm relationship between french president emmanuel macron and merkel. if they can rekindle the franco-german motor, europe could take on greater responsibility for its own defence. ironically, this is just what trump and his predecessors have been urging. there is even talk of an independent european nuclear deterrent, though many still see that as far-fetched. likewise, freeland’s speech to \n",
            "canada’s parliament included a pledge to step up the country’s defence spending. if the universe has a sense of humour, trump’s accidental legacy could be to convince the rest of the world to step into america’s shoes. \n",

            "if mr yi is correct, china’s population at the end of last year was 1.29bn, compared to the government’s official figure of 1.38bn. india’s population is officially estimated at 1.33bn.\n",
            "mr yi’s research, which was presented to academics in beijing this week, highlights the demographic crisis confronting chinese policymakers. china’s working age population fell for the first time in 2012 and has been declining ever since, raising the prospect that the country may “get old before it gets rich”.\n",

            "“i haven’t looked at india’s population figures,” mr yi told the financial times. “but its population will soon exceed china’s if it hasn’t already and will eventually be far greater.”\n",
            "the national health and family planning commission, which enforces china’s population-control policies, challenged mr yi’s research, saying on thursday that the country’s current fertility rate is 1.7 per cent. “[his claims] are completely untrue,” it said. “they do not accord with the facts.”\n",
            "mr yi is a longstanding critic of china’s controversial “one child” policy, which was enforced from the early 1980s until 2015.\n",
            "in his 2007 book, big country with an empty nest, he argued that the malthusian fears of chinese communist party planners were unwarranted.\n",
            "most chinese officials and scholars now accept that the one child policy hastened the arrival in china of the “lewis turning point” — set out in 1954 by economist arthur lewis — which describes the moment when a country’s surplus rural labour pool is exhausted and wages begin to rise rapidly. this will make it much harder for china to match the easy productivity gains of the past quarter-century.\n",
            "mr yi believes that without the one child policy, china’s population would have peaked at 1.6bn in 2040 before beginning to decline, allowing the world’s second-largest economy to enjoy a much longer “demographic dividend”.\n",
            "his contrarian views were for years unwelcome in the chinese government, which banned his book until 2013. but as beijing officials began to appreciate the real costs of the one child policy, they warmed to the us-based academic.\n",
            "in march, the chinese government flew mr yi business class from the us to attend the boao forum for asia, an annual gathering in southern china modelled on the world economic forum’s davos meeting.\n",

            "a survey of business leaders has found australian companies are the worst prepared for the arrival of artificial intelligence (ai) technologies among selected major economies, despite spending the second-largest amount of money on automation.independent research agency vanson bourne was commissioned by it company infosys (which as a seller of an ai platform has a vested interest in promoting such technology) to poll 1,600 business leaders of companies with more than 1,000 staff and at least us$500m in annual revenue across australia, china, the united states, germany, france, india and the uk.according to the survey, released at the world economic forum last week, major australian businesses invested an average of $7.9m last year in ai, behind only the us, but placed last in both the skills required for ai takeup and in plans to integrate ai.the infosys australia regional head, andrew groth, told the guardian the survey demonstrates that australia risks becoming uncompetitive.“the challenge is the skills situation,” he said. “if not addressed, [our] level of competitiveness could be a challenge, as all companies adopting ai are seeing advantages. we are all competing on the global stage. it’s here and we need to address these challenges.”the survey found 23% of australian business leaders believe their company completely lacks the skills needed to capitalise on ai.groth said ai requires proficiency in stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) skills, digital proficiencies, creativity and problem-solving, as well as ongoing learning.he said the lack of skills was relevant to another of the survey’s findings – that australian business leaders are the most likely to be planning to make workers redundant rather than reassign those whose roles have been made obsolete by ai technology.two-thirds of australian businesses polled said they plan to or already have replaced jobs with ai, with a third of those leaders saying the affected workers will be made redundant.groth was keen to focus on the two-thirds of businesses that intend to reassign rather than sack those in jobs better done by ai.he cited as an example the fiona stanley hospital in perth, which last year brought in an automated pharmaceutical ordering system that utilises robots which scan, move and store $200,000 worth of drugs daily, with the workforce previously responsible reassigned to other tasks.“using [artificial intelligence] reduced stock availability outages by 70% and freed up nurses for patient care rather than admin of stock,” he said.ai is even impacting on infosys’ own global workforce. groth said between 8,000 and 9,000 jobs had been automated at the company over the past year, but almost all affected employees were given other roles within the company.infosys’ human resources head, krishnamurthy shankar, has conceded  that, over time, improved ai capabilities will see the company hire less new employees.a 2015 ceda report found 40% of australian jobs were under threat from automation. but university of new south wales professor of ai, toby walsh, said that figure was unlikely as as many new jobs would be created as eliminated by automation. he said the jobs wipeout would be felt most by entry-level workers.“we are already seeing the beginning of that trend; companies are not making the difficult decision of letting go of employees, but instead are avoiding bringing in new young workers to fill positions,” he said.“that doesn’t have to mean less prosperity however. if machines create more wealth, it is just a matter of distribution.“one popular idea is a universal basic income, for which there are experiments in a number of countries, but that is not the only lever – there could be taxations on corporations and the very rich. or there’s no fundamental reason the weekend has to be two days’ long – making it three days would ease the jobs shortage.”for the jobs that are safe from automation, ai will still have an impact in improving efficiencies in our professional and personal lives. commissioned by ai personal assistant firm julie desk, censuswide carried out another industry-funded survey across the uk in november/december and found 47% of professionals were willing to hand responsibility for scheduling meetings, booking restaurants and other administrative tasks over to ai personal assistants.the survey of 1,000 people indicated a generational gap in terms of trust in an ai personal assistant – nearly 62% of respondents aged 16 to 24 said they would trust an ai for handling the back and forth emailing of such tasks compared with 35% of those aged 55+.the survey indicated roughly two hours a week would be saved by automating such tasks, with respondents saying they would redeploy this time to pursuits such as taking care of their family (24%), going shopping (21%) and making love (20%).\n",

            " it’s a battle that shows not just how hard activism is becoming, but how difficult it is for the average person to know exactly what is going on. \n",
            " the old alcoa split last year, spinning off its aluminum production business into a new company with the old name of alcoa. the parent company became arconic, one of those corporate-speak names, probably meant to invoke an epcot-like future in some marketing manager’s mind. \n",
            " the split was a crowning achievement for klaus kleinfeld, the alcoa chief executive, who chose to lead arconic. mr. kleinfeld took the reins of alcoa in 2008 in the depths of the financial crisis when the company was being battered. his long tenure has been focused on rebuilding the aluminum manufacturing business while making a series of purchases to form the newer arconic. \n",
            " mr. kleinfeld’s path to a rebuilt alcoa had been anything but puppies and rainbows. alcoa recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, but its stock price since he took the reins has lagged aluminum peers by almost 20 percent and the standard & poor’s 500-stock index by 150 percent. \n",
            " still, much of that poor stock performance against peers is attributable to that horrific first year in 2008, and alcoa has outperformed aluminum peers since. \n",
            " enter elliott management. the hedge fund announced that it had taken a stake around the time mr. kleinfeld announced the company split. \n",
            " at first, the hedge fund’s strategy could well have been to push for the same split. company spinoffs are, after all, a stock trick of hedge funds, providing an event that will likely spur a stock increase, allowing the hedge fund to sell and profit. \n",
            " the separation announcement brought peace for about a year as elliott was allowed to put three independent directors on the arconic board. \n",
            " now, however, war has erupted as elliott has nominated five directors to replace the company’s board. the activist investor has called for mr. kleinfeld to be fired and replaced by elliott’s own handpicked chief executive, larry lawson, who led spirit aerosystems holdings. \n",
            " how did things get so bad? \n",
            " from the public record, elliott’s grievance appears to lie entirely with mr. kleinfeld. the hedge fund paints him as a dilettante who is more interested in being at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, or meeting with president trump than in running a business. \n",
            " arconic, meanwhile, has disappointed on quarterly results both as a spinoff and before. elliott complains of high corporate spending, like a corporate marketing campaign that plays off the 1960s cartoon “the jetsons” and an expensive headquarters in lever house on park avenue in manhattan. (the company inherited the building in the split.) while arconic is spending too much, elliott says the new alcoa is busy cutting costs. \n",
            " the hedge fund also contends that mr. kleinfeld has overspent on acquisitions that have not borne fruit, while ignoring the development of a domestic chinese aluminum market as a competitor. and arconic’s margins are lower than a competitor, precision castparts. \n",
            " arconic has a response and its own set of facts. in investor presentations and elsewhere, the company has argued that mr. kleinfeld took over a troubled company and created the arconic business through acquisitions. moreover, this business is dependent on personal relationships that he has established through his global profile. \n",
            " as for those pesky margins, arconic says it is focused on increasing profit margins and has a plan, while comparisons with precision castparts are inapt because arconic is an array of different businesses. \n",
            " in addition, all the directors of arconic currently support mr. kleinfeld, including the three elliott-nominated directors. and finally, arconic’s stock has been on a tear since the spinoff last november — up more than 54 percent. to be sure, some of that may be a result of the “trump bump” rally in the stock market, but as arconic argues, “the separation has enhanced the respective businesses and unlocked substantial value for shareholders.” \n",
            " if your head is spinning right now, join the club. \n",
            " this is the new shareholder activism. the low-hanging fruit, and tricks like selling the company or spinning off a business, are drying up. \n",
            " instead, a few shareholder activists are now trying something much harder — actually digging into the operations of a company and working to turn it around. \n",
            " this is more like private equity than shareholder activism. and these investors are new at this, but this is the wave of future activism, to the extent that it persists. in part, this explains the recent shareholder activism trend of putting up candidates for chief executive, which is happening right now in situations involving the railroad operator csx and the retailer tiffany’s. \n",
            " as for arconic, ordinary shareholders will get nowhere trying to puzzle through these new battles. each salvo back and forth contains a nugget of information, but not a bigger picture. \n",
            " if you want that broad view, then perhaps the best thing is to ignore the chatter about expensive headquarters and davos and focus on the business. and it seems to be a business that continues to fall short of wall street’s forecasts. last quarter, its first as an independent company, arconic reported adjusted earnings of 12 cents a share, a penny below the consensus estimate. \n",
            " the weakness may not be enough to justify ousting mr. kleinfeld, a man who has been with this business a long time and is executing on a split that elliott supported. \n",
            " still, it is hard to see him surviving. most chief executives who fight vicious shareholder battles are unable to hang on — and even those who win such a contest depart shortly thereafter, as did ellen kullman at dupont. \n",
            " that’s the price chief executives pay for their high compensation — in mr. kleinfeld’s case as much as $18 million in recent years. \n",
            " if elliott wins, it will then have to do the hard work of working with a new chief executive to execute on the company’s strategy, something these investors may or may not have the skills to do. \n",
            " and so, that is where arconic seems to be heading — toward a referendum on its chief executive that most outsiders cannot understand, and a future that involves uncertainty. \n",
            " expect more of these types of situations as shareholder activists increasingly try to become turnaround experts, and shareholders try to puzzle through whose judgment is best. \n",
            " \n",
            "beijing — president trump and the chinese president, xi jinping, are in a bind. mr. trump’s slogan is to “make america great again,” while mr. xi’s motto is “great rejuvenation of the chinese nation.” the phrases have the same meaning: each leader suggests his country has declined and claims that he will restore it to the top position in the world. but the triumph of one country is built on the failure of the other. it’s a zero-sum game. \n",
            " mr. trump’s move on monday to abandon the trans-pacific partnership — an obama administration trade proposal meant to strengthen america’s economic power at china’s expense — leaves little doubt that the president will follow through with his campaign promises to upend american trade policies, including those toward china. taken with mr. trump’s postelection telephone chat with the leader of taiwan, tsai ing-wen, a major break with diplomatic protocol, we can expect a jolt to united states-china relations. \n",
            " but while a trade war, military skirmishes in the south china sea or taiwan strait, or other diplomatic crises could cause a hiccup in china’s rise, the trump era will offer plenty of opportunities for beijing. china has a chance to become a full-fledged superpower if it responds to the trump presidency by opening up more to the world economically and politically. \n",
            " china has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of globalization, which helped bring hundreds of millions of chinese people out of poverty in the past three decades. and as much as mr. trump would like to freeze the forces of free trade, the world will keep globalizing. \n",
            " mr. trump’s scrapping of the trans-pacific partnership is a chance for beijing to strengthen its position as the economic leader of east asia by bolstering regional trade. china is party to a free-trade agreement with southeast asian nations, and beijing should encourage south korea and australia to join that pact. japan is reluctant to become part of a trade group that includes china, so beijing should leave tokyo behind. \n",
            " the chinese leadership should also end its long-held policy of avoiding formal alliances. as the trump administration signals it may ignore beijing’s one-china policy  and treat taiwan as an independent country, potentially upending the bedrock of american-chinese relations since 1979, beijing should establish military alliances with as many neighbors as possible. china has so-called strategic partnerships with most of its neighbors, but only pakistan is a traditional military ally. \n",
            " if china were to form meaningful bilateral military pacts with cambodia, thailand, malaysia and especially the philippines, america would have more difficulty joining a potential war in the taiwan strait — a very real possibility given mr. trump’s threats to the status quo. \n",
            " an east asian trade agreement and a raft of new formal alliances would help beijing take the position as the leader of east asia and make the region safer. \n",
            " mr. trump’s antidemocratic tendencies in the domestic arena, along with his threats to build a wall across america’s border with mexico, offer another opportunity for china in immigration policy. \n",
            " an illiberal turn in the united states could drive talented americans to seek careers abroad, while skilled workers the world over may start looking somewhere other than the united states to make a better life. by adopting a more open policy toward immigrants — including the creation of a path to citizenship for some categories of immigrants — china could expand its economy while improving its moral standing globally. in doing so, beijing could greatly reduce america’s soft-power advantage. \n",
            " on the bilateral front, a trade war between china and the united states seems likely under mr. trump. still, beijing should be considering ways to reduce its trade surplus with the united states and avoid a battle. meanwhile, if the chinese bought fewer american bonds, the trump administration would find it harder to pay for its plans to rebuild domestic infrastructure. \n",
            " there are signs that the chinese leadership is already stepping in to fill the leadership void developing under mr. trump’s presidency. last week, mr. xi spoke at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, recommitting china to globalization and free trade. china is also poised to take a leading role in environmental policy, given mr. trump’s hostility toward climate agreements. \n",
            " relations between china and the united states will inevitably deteriorate with mr. trump at the helm. the nuclear deterrent should still prevent an all-out war, but confrontation will be the core of these two giants’ relationship for the foreseeable future. \n",

            "beijing — for china, president trump’s scrapping of the american-brokered pacific trade agreement is a chance to extend beijing’s economic and political influence. and it is an opportunity to deepen ties with its neighbors in asia. \n",
            " but with a cooling economy at home and a looming leadership shake-up, the last thing president xi jinping wants is a trade war, though officials are girding for that possibility. rather, china’s leaders crave stability and predictability. \n",
            " early signs indicate they may not get their wish. the chinese fear that if mr. trump was willing to toss aside years of delicate negotiations with allies and decades of american trade policy, he could also go his own way on issues he has staked out with beijing, including taiwan and the south china sea. \n",
            " as if to bolster that point, on monday — the same day that mr. trump withdrew from the trans-pacific partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement — his spokesman said the united states would prevent china from accessing islands it claims in the south china sea, a threat that one nationalist chinese newspaper had already warned would mean war. \n",
            " “this shows that trump might act on his words,” deng yuwen, a public affairs commentator in beijing, said in an interview. “with previous presidents, their election promises weren’t taken so seriously.” \n",

            " mr. trump’s goal in squelching the trade agreement was to protect american jobs and businesses. his trade officials have argued that the deal does not do enough to help the united states or to contain china, which was not invited to join the agreement. \n",
            " but in killing an agreement designed to limit china’s vast economic reach in asia and anchor america’s presence in the world’s fastest growing region, analysts said, mr. trump created a void that president xi was already practicing to fill. \n",
            " only last week, mr. xi was trying on the mantle of global leadership at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, suggesting that with the united states in retreat, china was prepared to step up as a champion of free trade and protector of the global environment. \n",
            " mr. xi has kept china’s economy behind high walls, and china remains the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but inconsistencies have never ruffled the president. \n",
            " “this is indeed a big win for china in the struggle for global leadership,” said zhang baohui, director of the center for asia pacific studies at lingnan university in hong kong. “trump is surrendering this opportunity to prove the continuing relevance of american primacy.” \n",
            " the death of the trade agreement is likely to accelerate beijing’s push for its alternative trade agreement, the china-centered regional comprehensive economic partnership. \n",
            " that agreement would exclude the united states and would reduce or eliminate tariffs on trade among china, southeast asian nations, australia, india, japan, south korea and new zealand. it includes few of the features of t.p.p. that would have been most awkward for beijing, such as protections for independent labor unions and the environment, and requirements that state-owned enterprises behave more like commercial enterprises. \n",
            " the agreement has stalled on rifts between southeast asian nations and the others, but thailand’s minister of commerce, apiradi tantraporn, said monday that the talks “are expected to be expedited” without the t.p.p. \n",
            " but the end of the t.p.p. will not be mr. trump’s last word on trade with china. \n",

            " mr. trump’s trade officials have threatened to impose high tariffs on chinese goods, starting with heavily subsidized products such as steel and aluminum, imported into the united states. “it’s a little weird that we have very low tariffs and china has very high tariffs,” wilbur ross, the nominee for commerce secretary, said at his senate confirmation hearing last week. \n",
            " last week, china proposed allowing greater foreign investment in certain sectors, but there was little confidence the recommendations would be carried out in the foreseeable future, and american businesses said they felt less welcome in china than before. \n",
            " while mr. trump’s advisers say that china has more to lose than the united states in a trade war, chinese officials told visiting american businessmen last week that beijing was prepared. they had developed lists of punitive options they would take against the united states if washington took the initiative, they said. \n",
            " “the signals are very clear: if this is going to be a trade war, china will reduce imports of american aircraft from boeing and agricultural products,” said wu xinbo, director of american studies at fudan university in shanghai. “we can turn to europe, australia and canada for those products. and we know that 20 to 30 of the states in the united states with big agricultural lobbies and boeing plants will be putting pressure on congress.” \n",
            " a long-serving american trade expert in china agreed, saying china was prepared to go to the mat. \n",
            " “trump’s trade team would be wise to shelve ‘the art of the deal’ and focus on the ‘art of war,’ if they really want to know what’s ahead in u.s.-china trade relations,” said james zimmerman, a managing partner of the beijing office of the law firm sheppard, mullin, richter & hampton who has worked in china for 19 years. “china views trump as a paper tiger that will likely back down on the complicated, thorny issues that are not negotiable. the chinese also know that trump won’t risk a trade war lest the business community will be up in arms.” \n",
            " others, though, detect anxiety, and read china’s outward confidence as bluster. bilahari kausikan, ambassador at large for singapore, said china had “a real insecurity about a trade war.” \n",
            " both sides are likely to lose, he said, but china stands to lose more “since the u.s. domestic political order is not at stake in the same way as the chinese communist party rule may be at stake.” \n",
            " the next few months, as mr. xi focuses on choosing new members of the ruling standing committee for his second five-year term, will be a particularly tense political period, and economic instability is the last thing he needs. similarly, he will try at all costs to appear strong to his domestic, nationalistic audience in the face of challenges from mr. trump on taiwan and the south china sea. \n",
            " mr. trump has suggested that the one china policy, under which the united states recognizes the government of beijing and not taiwan, is not sacrosanct, a major concern for mr. xi. \n",
            " “in a year of political transition, xi cannot afford to come across as weak,” said paul haenle, the director of the carnegie-tsinghua center for global policy in beijing, who served as china director for the national security council under president george w. bush and president barack obama. “taiwan is the core of core issues for china — a bottom line. many chinese stress that it is nonnegotiable.” \n",
            " but for now, at least, the increased contention with washington is likely to strengthen mr. xi’s political hand at home by rallying public and elite support against a foreign threat, said minxin pei, a professor at claremont mckenna college in california who studies chinese politics and chinese-american relations. \n",
            " “short term, it will almost certainly give the chinese government a boost in its public support,” dr. pei said in a telephone interview. “it helps xi, because whenever there is such pressure from outside, chinese officials tend to rally around the top leader.” \n",
            " mr. trump has also threatened china on control of territory it claims in the south china sea. the comments by mr. trump’s press secretary, sean spicer, on monday echoed those made by his nominee for secretary of state, rex w. tillerson, at his senate confirmation hearing. \n",
            " while mr. trump has not explained how he will keep china off islands where it has built airstrips and installed weapons, the comments by his appointees suggest the possibility of an american blockade. while mr. obama tried unsuccessfully to leverage american allies in the region to compel china to back down, mr. trump seems willing to abandon them and face china on his own. \n",
            " that go-it-alone attitude has raised alarms at the pentagon and among american navy experts, who said such a blockade would be tantamount to war. the idea has also alarmed america’s allies. \n",
            " australia, washington’s staunchest ally in the asia pacific region, would not participate in such a venture, its defense officials said, adding that a blockade could not be successful and could serve to persuade disenchanted american friends in the asia pacific to pivot toward china. \n",
            " with mr. trump portending divisive action on many fronts, mr. xi was calm and prepared, his foreign minister, wang yi, suggested. \n",

            " but don’t fall into the “trap” of believing that this means the law is above the communist party, warns china’s top judge. speaking to a national conference of court officials on jan. 14, zhou qiang, the head of the supreme people’s court of china, left no doubt that china’s legal system is not independent of party rule. he called on judges to “show the sword” against erroneous western notions like judicial independence, separation of powers and constitutional democracy. \n",

            " chief justice zhou’s comments were all the more noteworthy coming just as president xi jinping and a large delegation of chinese leaders prepared to descend on the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, to general plaudits as the new champions of globalization and global trade. at home, mr. xi has increasingly cracked down on critics, human rights lawyers and nonprofit organizations. \n",
            " mr. xi’s repression has also been aimed at criticism of mao zedong, including discussion of his disastrous economic policies or the cultural revolution. accordingly, chief justice zhou also exhorted the gathered judges to “safeguard by law images of leaders and heroes.” \n",
            " before his current post, the chief justice was the top official in hunan province, hailed as a rising reformist star in the communist firmament. whether he felt the need to make a public show of fealty to mr. xi to advance his political fortunes is not clear. \n",
            " but when mr. xi is being hailed in davos by klaus schwab, the founder of the forum, for making china a haven from the “uncertainty and volatility” of the rest of the world, chief justice zhou’s comments at least provided a needed reminder of how that purported stability is really achieved and enforced. \n",

            " “we should resolutely resist erroneous influence from the west: ‘constitutional democracy,’ ‘separation of powers’ and ‘independence of the judiciary,’” chief justice zhou, the head of the supreme people’s court of china, said in a speech to legal officials in beijing. “we must make clear our stand and dare to show the sword.” \n",
            " the speech was widely seen as a bow to the strict political climate that president xi jinping has established in china, as a major communist party conclave approaches this year. though mr. xi won plaudits this week at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, for his support of economic globalization, at home he has overseen a yearslong program to constrain civil society, promote adulation for mao zedong, stamp out support for an independent press and sharply limit speech on the internet. \n",

            " one chinese scholar who spoke out was he weifang, a law professor at peking university, whose own online post criticizing the remarks was removed from the internet. in the post, he said it was wrong to call judicial independence a western concept, citing the example of bao zheng, a famous chinese judge who lived about 1,000 years ago and was celebrated for his just decisions. \n",

            " mr. cohen said that remark was consistent with mr. xi’s effort to whitewash the image of mao, communist china’s first leader. since 2013, the communist party has spoken out against the notion of “historical nihilism,” which it takes to mean any denigration of the historical image of mao and the party, including discussion of mao’s disastrous economic policies in the late 1950s or his chaotic cultural revolution. \n",

            " while his position is prestigious, chief justice zhou is not a member of the communist party’s ruling politburo. before mr. xi’s ascension to power in 2012, the jurist was a rising star, serving as the top official in hunan, mao’s home province. he was frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for a top leadership position. \n",

            " “people who know him find him a reasonable person who’s had a good legal education and who had been open before he became chief justice to improvements in the legal system,” mr. cohen said. “this must be pretty bitter gruel for him to swallow in order to try to bring the courts into a kind of militant observance of the highest party leadership.” \n",

            " indeed, the metaphor he used to reject protectionism — “like locking oneself in a dark room” — could just as well have been used to describe china’s political path under his leadership, with the communist party overtly guiding a campaign to restrict the influence of what it labels western notions such as democracy. this month, china’s top judge delivered a speech sharply criticizing the idea of an independent judiciary, which he said must be “resolutely rejected.” \n",

            " none of these details were featured in mr. xi’s highly choreographed appearance at the gathering that has become a rite of passage into the ranks of the global elite. \n",
            " for klaus schwab, executive chairman of the world economic forum, the participation of china’s president amounted to a public relations coup because it was the first time a chinese head of state had attended. mr. schwab obliged with his trademark soft treatment. he asked no questions, solicited none from the audience, and delivered an introductory address so laudatory that it provoked winces among some in the audience. \n",
            " “in a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility, the international community is looking to china to continue its responsive and responsible leadership in providing all of us with confidence and stability,” mr. schwab said. \n",

            " “this appears to be a time of uncertainty in the united states, in the u.k.,” said kai-fu lee, a prominent venture capitalist in beijing who invests in emerging chinese companies. “the world needs strong leaders to give the world confidence.” \n",

            " in conversations on the sidelines, many expressed concerns about the threats of tariffs from the incoming trump administration, fearing the consequences of a potential trade war between the world’s two largest economies. but most assumed tough rhetoric would eventually give way to the realities of shared commercial interests. \n",

            " “eventually, they will cooperate to get more benefits,” mr. fu said. “at the beginning, trump will say something very harsh. he will try to do something punishing. but this is a double-edged sword. once he’s in the white house, he will see things differently.” \n",

            "in a keynote address, chinese president xi jinping issued a full-throated defense of international trade and economic integration, portraying beijing as a benevolent power intent on upholding an international order that has boosted common prosperity. with doubts about the merits of globalization mounting in the u.s. and elsewhere in the west, mr. xi’s speech was portrayed by some who saw it as a move to fill a global leadership vacuum. some in the audience questioned china’s readiness. mr. xi, the first chinese head of state to attend the forum, also offered an implicit rebuke of mr. trump, who has threatened to impose tariffs on china. “no one will emerge as a winner in a trade war,” he said.\n",
            "it fell to anthony scaramucci, the trump administration’s ambassador to the global elite at davos, to respond. mr. scaramucci—hedge-fund showman, conference organizer, trump confidant—is joining the trump administration as an assistant to the president with a focus on explaining his ideas and projects to americans. he depicted the system of global trade, whose apostles and architects compose the core of the davos audience, as in need of repair. mr. trump “could be one of the last great hopes for globalism,” he said.\n",
            "earlier in the day, on a panel i moderated on monetary policy, mr. scaramucci said that the trump administration wants an independent federal reserve and must be careful about a rising dollar. he argued the u.s. economy could withstand the impact of a strong dollar, but warned that deflation could cause a downturn that would be worse than past economic crises.\n",
            "meanwhile, the dollar tumbled to its lowest level in a month after mr. trump said in an interview published monday that he favors a weaker dollar, breaking with decades of tradition and intensifying investor concern over the new administration’s capacity for surprising policy shifts. still, with markets improving and a pro-business administration poised to take over in washington, the mood among global corporate and financial leaders in davos is upbeat, despite the surge of antiglobal sentiment. many corporate executives said they were enthusiastic about the prospect that the trump administration will roll back taxes and regulation and spur economic growth after years of lackluster activity. by and large, they brushed aside concerns that trade and other policies of the new administration may be counterproductive.\n",

            "uber, under the guidance of david plouffe, who was barack obama’s campaign manager, has worked hard to present a more grown-up image. in may, the company brought in a board of heavyweight policy advisers that included neelie kroes, the former european competition commissioner, and ray lahood, a former us secretary of transportation. \n",
            "chief executive travis kalanick, known for his brash style, started adopting a more subdued tone. “we haven’t done everything perfectly,” he told a conference in october. “we have made mistakes.” \n",
            "yet the company has still clashed with city after city, showing that its brazen approach has not entirely disappeared. in austin, uber pulled out after a voter referendum that demanded fingerprint checks for its drivers, a measure with which uber refused to comply. in san francisco, the company pushed ahead with testing self-driving vehicles even though it lacked a permit to do so — and continued to run the tests even after receiving a cease and desist letter from the state. \n",
            "in addition to these city-level skirmishes, the bigger long-term threat to uber’s business model is the question of whether its drivers are independent contractors or employees. the company considers all its drivers to be independent contractors, which means they do not receive benefits such as healthcare and are not guaranteed the minimum wage. \n",
            "in april, uber agreed to a payout of up to $100m for drivers in california and massachusetts, who argued that they should be classified as employees, not contractors. that settlement was thrown out and the case is now under appeal. \n",
            "in london, a ruling in october found that uber drivers should be considered “workers”, entitled to a minimum wage and holiday pay. uber is appealing the ruling, but the result is expected to encourage other uber drivers to bring similar lawsuits. \n",
            "in the us, many so-called sharing economy companies that rely on independent contractors could see their business models upended if courts determine that their workers should be treated as employees. \n",
            "companies are trying to skirt the issue by making their contractors agree to arbitration — rather than class action — in the case of a dispute. this makes it much more difficult for workers to bring big class action cases.\n",

            "in contrast to uber’s reputation for brazenness, airbnb has tried to cultivate a good guy image. over the past year it has poured resources into grassroots initiatives, setting up more than 100 airbnb clubs for hosts and guests globally, in the hope these will grow into a political force to shape local regulation in its favour. \n",
            "“they always had to be more careful than uber, because airbnb involves more trust and intimacy,” says max wolff, a strategist at 55 capital who follows late-stage start-ups. \n",
            "“a year or so ago, airbnb got more of a feeling of invincibility,” he adds. “they believed their popularity with hosts who needed the money, and guests who liked the experience, would help provide political momentum.” \n",
            "however, the regulatory setbacks have come thick and fast. in october, new york passed a law that imposes heavy fines on short-term apartment rentals. airbnb sued the state in response, arguing that the law was unconstitutional, but settled the lawsuit in december. from berlin to barcelona to san francisco, airbnb has increasingly faced sanctions and restrictions on who can let their home and how often. \n",
            "in response, the company has started to adjust its model in major markets, a tacit acknowledgment that it has too much to lose from doing battle with regulators. \n",
            "in two of its largest markets, london and amsterdam, airbnb will begin blocking its hosts from letting homes for more nights than the legal limit next year, which will curb its revenue growth in those markets. in new york and san francisco, the company has banned new hosts from having more than one listing, in an effort to limit commercial operators. \n",
            "such concessions are a stark reversal by a company that long resisted policing its hosts on the grounds that it is the hosts, not airbnb, who are responsible for complying with local laws. \n",

            "looking ahead, a big wild card for uber, airbnb and many silicon valley start-ups will be the policies of the trump administration. the president-elect’s scant remarks on tech policy mean that much is still unknown. \n",
            "one potential area of political action could be employment law, which could be good news for uber’s worker classification lawsuits. bradley tusk, an adviser to uber and an investor in the company, says he is cautiously optimistic that congress might pass legislation to create a third employment category that falls between full-time employee and independent contractor. \n",
            "both uber and airbnb already have ties to the incoming administration. peter thiel, an adviser on trump’s transition team, is an investor in airbnb. and mr kalanick, uber’s chief executive, was recently appointed an adviser to mr trump’s business policy forum. silicon valley’s biggest start-ups have a seat at the table at last.\n",
            "one of the ways uber has tried to head off potential labour issues this past year is by lending its support to a new type of labour organisation: the guild. falling somewhere between a formal labour union and a trade association, the independent drivers guild for uber drivers in new york city, launched in may, has been pioneering a different model of representation. \n",
            "the guild has already signed up roughly 45,000 uber drivers since it was launched, says jim conigliaro jr, founder of the guild and the general counsel at the machinists union district 15, which is closely affiliated with the independent drivers guild. the guild draws most of its financial support from uber and it is free for drivers to sign up. it is planning to shift to a voluntary dues system soon, which will offer extra benefits such as life insurance. \n",
            "big issues for the guild so far have been tipping, which uber still does not allow through its app, and “deactivation”, which refers to when uber removes drivers from the system. working with the guild, uber has agreed that a committee of five uber drivers can be the ultimate arbiter over whether drivers are reactivated. this is a step forward from the previous system, under which drivers had no recourse to become reactivated. \n",
            "in the long term, however, the guild’s ambitions are much bigger. it hopes to work with uber and the freelancers union to create a centralised portable benefit fund that would help all independent contractors access better options for healthcare and retirement. \n",
            "because uber drivers are independent contractors, and not full-time employees, they are not eligible in the us for employee protections such as union membership, the right to collective bargaining and healthcare or pension plans. \n",
            "“this excluded class of worker is growing, and they don’t have access to unions,” says mr conigliaro. “i think it is important for unions to pivot, and to have another lane where they can bring workers up, and raise the floor for workers regardless of their classification.”\n",

            "when china’s central bank governor broke a six-month silence at the weekend, he suggested that critics of his institution’s communication strategy expected too much.\n",
            "“the central bank is neither god nor a magician who can turn uncertainties into certainties,” zhou xiaochuan told a chinese financial magazine on saturday, just two days before his country’s currency and equity markets were due to resume trading after the week-long chinese new year holiday.\n",
            "it had been a turbulent week on international markets and china has had a habit of making bad situations worse ever since a “one-off” devaluation of the renminbi last august. but mr zhou’s assurance that “there is no basis for devaluation” of the chinese currency appeared to have a soothing effect on monday, with the renminbi making its biggest daily gain against the dollar in more than a decade.\n",
            "for a central banker who professes not to be a magician, mr zhou does a pretty good disappearing act. with the exception of a september appearance at a meeting of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in turkey, when he wrongly suggested that chinese currency and stock markets were “stabilising”, the head of the people’s bank of china has been invisible.\n",
            "he even failed to make an appearance in november when the chinese government secured recognition of the renminbi as an official reserve currency from the international monetary fund — arguably the crowning achievement of one of the longest-running careers in central banking. mr zhou has headed the pboc for 14 years, during which time he has earned a reputation as one of the chinese government’s leading reformers.\n",
            "but his comments to caixin suggested that the pboc’s communication deficit had grown too large over recent months. many investors and analysts were surprised when mr zhou failed to appear at the world economic forum’s annual gathering in davos last month. the chinese government was represented instead by fang xinghai, an economic policy adviser to president xi jinping, and its little known vice-president, li yuanchao.\n",
            "“china lacks systemic communication about its monetary policy,” says xiang songzuo at renmin university’s center for international monetary research in beijing. “it is very important that the pboc establish a communication system with the domestic and international market. [mr zhou’s] interview suggests that they are heading in that direction.”\n",
            "according to wang jun, economist at the china center for international economic exchange, the pboc learned a hard lesson when its poorly communicated august devaluation — of just 1.9 per cent — was widely interpreted as the opening shot in a new currency war. it was in fact intended as a technical adjustment aimed at making the renminbi more market-driven as required by the imf in return for recognition as an official reserve currency.\n",
            "“[mr zhou] wanted to manage market expectations,” mr wang says. “that is exactly what many of our government departments are not good at doing or have long neglected to do.\n",
            "“the way they handled the august communication was very problematic — you can even call it a complete failure,” he adds. “this time they took the initiative to communicate with the market but there’s a lot of room for improvement.”\n",
            "while most analysts regard some communication from mr zhou as better than none, especially after such a long absence from public view, his choice of medium was criticised — even though caixin is, by the standards of china’s tightly controlled media industry, a relatively independent and respected financial magazine.\n",
            "“the caixin interview gives the impression of it being all very internal or insider-esque,” says fraser howie, a china financial markets expert. “if you want to have a reserve currency, interacting with the media and the markets is part and parcel of that. why doesn’t the pboc just come out and say that the governor will do a quarterly press conference?”\n",

            "the most interesting comment at davos this year came from the french economy minister emmanuel macron who said that he simply did not believe for a second the figures put out by the chinese government claiming that their economy had grown by 6.9 per cent in 2015. to anyone familiar with chinese statistics the comment is welcome because it brings into sharp focus the fact that no one can trust the data being produced by what is now one of the world’s largest economies. the doubts are not limited to macro economic numbers. chinese data on the energy sector also deserve to be regarded with great scepticism.\n",
            "there are three reasons why chinese data might be inaccurate. the first is that it is simply extremely hard to gather reliable data across a country which is so vast. good data is hard to come by. in nigeria gross domestic product was revised upwards in 2013 by 89 per cent because the old basis of calculation was inaccurate. there are many issues even in much smaller and more developed countries.\n",
            "second, getting good data is even harder when the economy is growing rapidly — as china’s has been for the last three decades. most statistics are assembled through a set of proxies and assumptions based on past behaviour, but if activity is growing rapidly and simultaneously changing in composition it is hard for even the most expert and honest statisticians to get the calculations right.\n",
            "the third issue and the real problem in china, however, is that statistics are used for propaganda purposes and as a tool of political management. the country has modernised in many ways since the death of chairman mao but it is still centrally run by the communist party whose primary, driving purpose is to stay in office.\n",
            "to admit that gdp grew at 2 rather than 7 per cent would cause a severe loss of face for the party and for president xi jinping. in addition, it would add to concerns about the durability of a chinese economy in which the ratio of debt to gdp is now probably more than 300 per cent. the government claims that only 1.6 per cent of those loans are non performing — a laughable figure. low gdp numbers would also raise the dangerous issue of unemployment — something that is not supposed to exist in the people’s republic. the economic restructuring now underway from heavy industry to services is clearly causing serious over capacity and job losses in areas such as steel production. with low growth, the scale of unemployment is undoubtedly greater than at any time since the end of the cultural revolution. telling the truth could be rather dangerous for a government that is ultra sensitive to criticism.\n",
            "the problem does not stop with gdp data. the chinese have recently put out various numbers on the energy sector, few of which stand up to detailed analysis. they claim, for instance, that while gdp grew at 6.9 per cent in 2015 electricity consumption rose by just 0.5 per cent. if true, that would represent one of the most remarkable gains in efficiency ever reported. coal consumption is said to have fallen by 5 per cent while renewables — led by wind — have grown dramatically. energy use per unit of gdp is now 18 per cent lower than it was in 2010 — well in excess of the government’s target.\n",
            "some of the claims being made are likely to be true directionally — the problem is exaggeration. there is, for instance, every reason to think that coal consumption is lower than previously expected and possibly down in absolute terms. renewables are certainly growing, although the recent figures on the pace of investment and the growth in market share look suspiciously high. the fall in coal use is more likely to be caused by the recession than by a sudden transformation of the energy mix.\n",
            "the fact is that in china numbers are designed to serve political purposes. within the country the government wants to show that it is dealing with the highly sensitive issue of urban air quality caused by coal burning power stations. externally, beijing wants to demonstrate that the country is moving in the right direction in terms of emissions and the response to climate change.\n",
            "in the past a blind eye has been turned to the dubious statistics. until recently, the country was largely self-sufficient and its activities had limited effect on the world energy market. but that has changed over the last decade. china now accounts for almost a quarter of total global energy consumption. the country imported 7.8 mbd of oil and some 200m tonnes of coal in 2015. coal imports fell dramatically — as did the price of domestic coal but oil imports continued to grow. it is unclear whether these are temporary or permanent phenomena.\n",
            "in all the main projections of the future global energy developments, chinese consumption is a crucial and growing influence on world markets. that we don’t know the facts with any degree of certainty means an extra element of speculation is added to already volatile markets.\n",
            "equally serious is the impact on the debate around emissions and climate change. after the paris agreement in december, the climate debate has moved into a phase where statistics showing whether countries are matching their commitments matter enormously. some commentators would like to believe that china is now a leader in the process of change. it would be good to think so, but real confidence requires hard data which can be trusted.\n",
            "last week, wang baoan, the head of china’s national bureau of statistics,  was dismissed on grounds of corruption. it is not clear if this relates to the manipulation of data. but if the chinese now wish to restore confidence in the data they publish they should appoint a senior independent non-chinese expert to fill the vacant role.\n",

            " tackling graft is the linchpin to fixing income inequality, environmental problems and creaking education and pension systems, and to appeasing growing public anger. for corruption erodes trust in government, as india’s congress party discovered when it was turned out of office in 2014, in large part because many ministers were seen as inept and corrupt. unlike in china, where the government has waged a top-down battle to root out dishonesty in the communist party, in india anti-corruption efforts have been fueled by citizens’ protests and a vibrant, free news media. \n",
            " beginning in 2011, the activist anna hazare, who describes himself as a disciple of gandhi and has the same friendly, spectacled look, engaged in fasts and protests for more than two years, prompting hundreds of thousands of indians to take to the streets. he wants the government to establish a national ombudsman’s office to investigate and prosecute corruption. so far, he has not succeeded at the national level, although a new anti-corruption party inspired by mr. hazare won recent local elections in delhi. \n",
            " prime minister narendra modi’s government has taken steps in the right direction by holding transparent auctions for public contracts, putting many government services online, and quietly making it harder for tycoons to get special favors. the most effective solution to date has come from outside the government, led by the internet entrepreneur, infosys founder and self-made billionaire nandan m. nilekani. \n",
            " mr. nilekani is no neo-gandhian folk hero. tall and impeccably dressed, with a graying rhett butler mustache, he is a regular at the annual world economic forum in davos, switzerland. \n",
            " about six years ago, with government support, mr. nilekani’s engineers created a biometric id program named aadhaar. aadhaar takes fingerprints and iris scans to generate a national identity number for every indian. more than one billion indians have signed up. those with numbers can now use a simple smartphone app to collect government pensions or scholarships, or receive banking services — all bribe-free. \n",
            " one of those it helped is ram, a farmer in central india (it’s common for rural indians to go by only one name). he works for the national rural employment guarantee scheme, which guarantees the poor a minimum of 100 days a year of paid work building roads or upgrading irrigation systems. to get his meager wages of 800 rupees (about $12) a week, mr. ram had to take a day off work, ride the roof of a creaking bus to a nearby town and line up in the dusty heat for three hours to see a local bureaucrat who would likely deduct a fee from mr. ram’s wages. the whole rigmarole reduced his actual pay by about a third. \n",
            " an indian government study found that, on average, people like mr. ram receive only 61 percent of the wages they are owed by the government. the rest just disappears. many government officials are barely paid a living wage, so this is also how they make ends meet. \n",
            " mr. ram is proud of his aadhaar id card. to get his wages, he now simply stops at his corner grocery store. the owner scans mr. ram’s fingerprints on a phone app and then pays him, keeping only a legal 10 rupee (16 cent) commission. \n",
            " those who have previously benefited from india’s opaque systems are naturally opposed to aadhaar. some politicians argued that the aadhaar system was a waste of money or infringed on privacy. mr. modi recently threw his support behind it, which silenced some of the critics. \n",
            " a recent world bank report said that digital id transfers are already saving the indian government $1 billion a year on just one fuel subsidy program. this success offers hope, but the rear-guard battle demonstrates what a herculean task broader reform will be. \n",
            " the aadhaar program and mr. modi’s emphasis on more open government contracting are an excellent start, but other possible fixes include setting up an independent commission to try the worst offenders — along the lines of what mr. hazare is proposing. india requires public officials to disclose their assets, but this is not always enforced. pay increases for state officials would also be a useful carrot to encourage compliance. above all, a comprehensive ethics and education campaign in schools and the news media would shift cultural norms away from seeing graft as an inevitable part of life. \n",

            "in december the central bank signaled through an editorial posted on its website—rather than an official announcement—its intention to move toward navigating the currency against a basket of currencies, even while maintaining a band. in january, the people’s bank of china allowed the currency to sharply deviate from its previous day’s close. each was a twist in a policy that hadn’t been fully laid out.\n",

            "      said the combination of “china moving toward a freer market and its inability to communicate freely” generates market volatility.\n",
            "a shift in china’s foreign-exchange regime is a potentially historic event. china is the world’s second largest economy and for years has sought stability by linking its currency to the currency of the world’s largest economy, the u.s. in the process, it built up foreign-exchange reserves that reached $4 trillion in value, adding to china’s enormous global financial clout.\n",
            "the link has become less tenable as the dollar has appreciated, lifting the chinese currency and undermining china’s efforts to boost sagging domestic output.\n",
            "it is not just investors with money at stake in the new exchange-rate regime. chinese firms with u.s. dollar borrowing have an incentive to move out of yuan now if the currency is on a path to depreciate.\n",
            "many central banks—in places as varied as the united kingdom, mexico, russia and indonesia—in the past three decades have tried and failed to navigate gradual currency adjustments.\n",
            "the slowing chinese economy “might require more readjustment of the currency,” ray dalio,  founder of bridgewater associates, a u.s. hedge fund, said on the panel. “it’s not always easy for governments to maintain their controls over the currency.”\n",
            "officials at the u.s. federal reserve and other central banks and financial institutions have been struggling to make sense of china’s moves, which affect their own economic prospects. for the fed, for example, a depreciating yuan puts downward pressure on inflation through cheaper imports at a time when the u.s. is trying to push inflation higher.\n",
            "“given the massive transition, there is a communication issue,” ms. lagarde said on thursday. “better communication certainly serves the transition.\n",
            "“we should do a better job,” mr. fang said on the panel. “we’re learning and doing it. i’m here to communicate.”\n",
            "china’s economy and central bank have taken on global relevance but it still has antiquated monetary practices compared with developed economies’ central banks. monetary policy decisions aren’t made independently by the central bank. nor does it hold news conferences or release a schedule of meetings or minutes of those meetings or provide public testimony on policy, as the fed and other central banks do.\n",
            "it has become increasingly costly to maintain the yuan’s crawling peg to the dollar. in the past two years, the pboc has burned through $700 billion of foreign-exchange reserves to maintain the yuan’s peg to the ever-strengthening dollar. those reserves now stand at $3.3 trillion, down from almost $4 trillion in mid-2014.\n",
            "maintaining the link has undermined other efforts to support the economy. by intervening in currency markets to keep the peg, the chinese central bank has bought yuan from chinese banks, effectively taking money out of china’s financial system even as beijing tries to make more money available to its businesses and consumers.\n",
            "a key source of confusion is how the pboc sets the closely watched reference rate for the yuan each day. the central bank announces the rate—dubbed “fixing”—each morning at 9:15 local time, and the yuan is allowed to move 2% above or below that level in mainland trading.\n",
            "when the pboc devalued the yuan in august, it said the central bank would start setting the fixing according to the yuan’s previous close, as a way to give the market more say in its value. specifically, the dozen or so market makers in china’s foreign-exchange market, including both chinese and foreign banks, were asked to look at the previous day’s close as a primary factor when deciding what price levels to submit to the central bank.\n",
            "the pboc delivered what it had promised in the following months, with the fixing set within an average of 0.02% of its previous close each trading day between late august and december.\n",
            "after it said it would shift to a basket approach in december, its execution again has been hard to decipher.\n",
            "in the first week of january, the central bank surprised the market by sharply fixing the yuan weaker than its previous close. that action caused a selloff of everything from the yuan, chinese stocks, global equities and commodities, as it fanned fears that china’s economy was slowing faster than beijing had let on and the central bank would engage in big currency devaluation to help revive growth.\n",
            "struggling to contain the near-panic selling, the central bank then moved to prop up the yuan by both setting stronger fixings and directly purchasing the yuan and selling dollars in the currency markets. in addition, the central bank has tightened capital controls to prevent money from leaving china and make it more expensive to bet against the chinese currency.\n",

            "pick an adjective to describe the current political mood—angry, anxious, populist—and one thing about the descriptor is certain: it will fit the atmosphere on both sides of the atlantic equally well.\n",
            "political trends in europe and the u.s. often move in synchronization, and rarely has that been more true than right now. in both places, the political establishment is shaking, fringe actors are moving to center stage, parties are changing face and voters appear to be tearing themselves loose from their traditional moorings.\n",
            "the obvious american manifestation of all those currents is the rise of donald trump—a billionaire who has changed his party registration five times, and who has no easily defined ideology or policy platform—as the leading republican presidential candidate. mr. trump’s best-known position is that he will shut the doors to illegal immigrants and, at least temporarily, to muslims. his main selling points are his willingness to call his country’s political class “stupid,” and his pledge to arrive in the washington china shop prepared to bust it up.\n",
            "but it isn’t only mr. trump—not by a long shot. leftist sen. bernie sanders is challenging seriously for the democratic nomination. more broadly, the kind of antiestablishment politics they practice were spreading in europe for months before they began their presidential runs. in europe and the u.s., the movement is fueled by middle-class economic insecurities, exacerbated by fear of immigrants arriving to steal jobs or soak up welfare money and other taxpayer dollars. those anxieties are overlaid with an absolute conviction among many citizens that existing political leaders either don’t understand or, worse yet, don’t care.\n",
            "the combination is a classic recipe for a populist outbreak, which can fuel movements of either the right or the left. and the upshot could be an environment more hostile not just to government elites but also to big business and financial interests.\n",
            "in europe, “you’re seeing, as in the u.s., that the political center has collapsed,” said heather conley,  a former state department official who now analyzes europe for the center for strategic and international studies. “collapsed and discredited. that’s why you’re seeing the increase on the far right and the far left.”\n",
            "thus, right-wing parties have surged in denmark, hungary and poland. in spain and greece, left-wing parties have risen in importance—and, in the case of greece, risen to the top of the government. and in the u.k., the labour party rank and file, frustrated at the failure of the party’s mainstream figures to win a national election that seemed within reach, responded by reaching to the party’s far left to make jeremy corbyn their leader.\n",
            "the trend has left europe’s traditional parties and their more centrist leaders scrambling to survive—and in some cases tacking toward people they once considered extremists in order to do so. “what is problematic is the fact that traditional mainstream parties are buying into that rhetoric, and they are modifying their policies,” said rosa balfour,  a senior fellow at the german marshall fund of the u.s.\n",
            "in france, the far-right national front led by marine le pen surged in an early round of regional elections late last year and was blocked from taking a share of power only because france’s two main parties, the republicans and the socialists, banded together to prevail in the final round.\n",
            "in the process, though, the two main parties’ beliefs seemed malleable; some republicans moved to the right on law and order and immigration to woo away potential le pen voters, while others moved to the left to attract socialist voters. even after such jockeying, though, the national front still recorded a historically high vote tally.\n",
            "while the causes of the political upheavals are similar in europe and the u.s., they aren’t identical. many middle-class americans are upset because they think recovery from the global financial crisis of 2007-08 has been uneven, benefiting mostly those at the top of the income ladder. in parts of europe the feeling is more that recovery has never come at all.\n",
            "\n",
            "moreover, the turn toward austerity in the wake of the financial crisis has in the eyes of some citizens shredded what they considered a sacrosanct social safety net. “what’s happened is the social compact between the european governments and its people has collapsed,” said ms. conley.\n",
            "in europe, the anger and frustration from such a turn of events can be funneled into already-existing fringe parties, or even into new ones that can be created relatively easily. in the u.s., by contrast, forming a third party or mounting an independent run for office is extraordinarily difficult, so unhappiness produces instead fractures within the existing parties.\n",
            "which is precisely what republicans are seeing with the rise of mr. trump, and democrats to a lesser extent with the strong presidential effort of mr. sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist.\n",
            "what such movements have in common, says ms. balfour, is this: “at times of crisis they are able to thrive because they are able to pick simple topics and provide very simple black-and-white solutions.”\n",

            "the negative implications for the financial sector of any association with the petrobras scandal were immediate. btg’s share price plunged nearly 40 per cent while those of its peers fell by 5 per cent or more. brazil’s currency also weakened, reflecting the rising political risk from the petrobras investigation. brazil’s economy is already on track for its worst recession since the great depression. \n",

            "he joined btg pactual in 1989 at the age of 21, working in the information technology division, before rising to take control of the institution with his partners only a decade later. in 2006 he sold the bank to ubs for $2.6bn, but after the 2009 financial crisis he bought it back for roughly the same amount and merged it with an asset management business he had started. \n",

            "for how many years do business leaders need to hear that their customers do not trust them nor the companies they lead before they do something about it?\n",
            "to coincide with the opening of the world economic forum in davos, public relations company edelman has just released its 15th annual trust barometer, which signals that a short recovery in people’s faith in the corporate sector has gone into reverse.\n",
            "in fact, trust in business declined in two-thirds of the 27 markets the survey covers and is now below 50% in 14 markets, the worst showing since 2008. the largest drops occurred in canada, germany, australia and singapore.\n",
            "even the once impregnable technology industry, which is still the most trusted sector, saw declines in the majority of countries for the first time. the fall in trust in ceos as credible spokespeople continued for the third consecutive year, with levels now at one third in developed markets. globally, ceos (at 43%) and government officials (at 38%) continue to be the least credible information sources, lagging far behind academic or industry experts, who are rated at 70%. only a fifth of respondents thought business leaders were the most trusted influencers to communicate purpose and engagement. \n",
            "it’s not difficult to see why the 33,000 people who took part in the edelman survey have so little confidence in ceos. for example, nearly half say that there is not enough regulation of business. across major industries surveyed, a similar percentage have little faith in policymakers to develop and implement appropriate regulations.\n",

            "where there’s muck there’s brass – or should that be the other way round? the business community must play a meaningful role in cleaning up the mess created by its unsustainable behaviour, but in the absence of tougher regulation will we have to rely on companies finding money-making opportunities in solving the existential challenges we face?\n",
            "that is one conclusion of a new report, published as global leaders meet in davos, that identifies and ranks 15 opportunities to transform the effects of extreme weather, our reliance of fossil fuels, and the sharp rise in chronic disease, water scarcity and mass urbanisation.\n",
            "the global opportunity report 2015, drawn together by scandinavian think tank monday morning global institute, norwegian certification group dnv gl and corporate sustainability membership group un global compact, is the result of a survey of 6,000 public and private sector leaders, and the thoughts of 200 sustainability experts from eight countries.\n",

            "the responses demonstrate that there is a common appetite for change in a handful of core areas. three of the top five responses from the survey relate to better water management: 37% argue that improving water efficiency in agriculture is a solution that businesses can be confident about and can also be put into practice most quickly. respondents also see a big opportunity from inspiring behaviour change in consumers, including increasing the numbers signing up to renewable energy.\n",
            "other business opportunities mentioned in the study include early warning and forecasting services to help limit the impact of extreme weather, developing rural growth initiatives to slow migration to cities, and using mobile technologies to reduce chronic health conditions.\n",
            "the heads of all three organisations together state that business leaders need to “break the link between the pursuit of human ambition and the depletion of the natural environment”. to do this organisations need to adopt a new mindset – “one where we abandon our natural inclination to focus on averting risk and start embracing opportunities for a sustainable and prosperous society”. they conclude that “these opportunities are abundant and they are ripe for harvest”.\n",
            "one interesting finding from the survey of attitudes is that the public sector is markedly less optimistic than the private sector about the possibility of improving society through these new business opportunities. those taking part in the survey argue that a lack of willpower from the public sector represents a critical impediment to change.\n",
            "as erik rasmussen, founder of monday morning global institute, puts it: “the governmental sector seems to be more reluctant and not seeing the same opportunities. this is a pity. governments can play an important role by issuing regulations that support both sustainability and business ventures. business and governments must share visions and initiatives.”\n",

            "the surprise finding was that, though it is still lacking, strong regulation is considered essential to create the right conditions for business to scale up innovation. in fact, female leaders, those aged under 30 and those from emerging economies in asia, sub-saharan africa and south america, all believe that regulation will smooth the path towards energy transition and better water management as sustainable business opportunities. henrik o madsen, group chief executive and president of dnv gl, said the strong embrace of regulation by these groups “gives us hope that we can see a stronger collaboration between the private and the public sector in the future”.\n",
            "businesses in emerging economies came out top in the survey of regions ready to pursue sustainable market opportunities. the manufacturing sector – especially in china, followed by india and south america – is most confident in its ability to deliver profits and prosperity in return for finding solutions to sustainability challenges. europe is the least optimistic, with less than a quarter of respondents believing it is possible to make significant progress.\n",
            "while many of the sustainability challenges faced are global in nature, how they are prioritised varies from region to region. chinese leaders give a preference to smart cities, while those in the middle east look first to improving water efficiency. healthcare came top of the list in south-east asia.\n",
            "dealing with extreme weather came bottom of the list of opportunities overall, but – in a sign of its lack of ambition on sustainability – improving early warning and forecasting services was seen as the most attractive of all 15 business opportunities in the us.\n",
            "rather than just looking to the future, the report cites 120 sustainable solutions that already exist and that others can learn from. these include a development agency covering the lake chilika basin in india, which is restoring wetlands and at the same time securing the livelihoods of 200,000 fishermen and 40,000 farmers; the israeli company netafim, which improves agricultural yields and crop quality via a drip irrigation system that delivers precise quantities of water and nutrients directly to crop roots; and airtel africa, which is preventing migration to cities with its “voice of the farmer” programme that provides farmers with agricultural information that increases their productivity and potential income.\n",
            "together with smart-city data providers, which use digital platforms to gather information about the way people and systems behave in the city and share these openly, all these answers take a global problem caused by business and turn it on its head. in doing so, there’s profit to be made – and that’s a reason for optimism.\n",

            "he has personal experience of this, having chaired a commission in norway that in 2006 came up with a 15-point plan to solve the climate problem if every norwegian was willing to pay €250 (£191) in extra taxes every year for the next generation or so.\n",

            "another sensible change, he argues, would be to lengthen the election period in order to give politicians time to implement unpopular measures before they lose the next election, and to guarantee all workers receive an adequate salary after their “dirty” jobs have been closed down until they get new “clean” jobs.\n",

            "beijing — as president xi jinping accelerated his sweeping campaign against government corruption, political enemies and western influences in china, he deployed the communist party’s most powerful propaganda tool, the state television network, like a hammer. \n",
            " news programs on the network, china central television, showed confessions by prominent businessmen before they had even been put on trial. foreign companies like apple were smeared by so-called investigations programs. heavily edited excerpts from the trial of a fallen party leader were broadcast in prime time to hundreds of millions of viewers. \n",
            " but now the wrath of the party has turned on the network itself. an inquiry into corruption at cctv, as the network is known, has shaken up the nation’s most influential news and propaganda organization, riveting the country with reports involving a seamy mix of celebrities, sex and bribery. \n",
            " at least 15 senior network employees have disappeared into the maw of party and state detention, according to official news reports and people who have been tracking the investigations. the most famous, rui chenggang, 37, a smooth-talking financial news anchor who wore italian suits and drove a jaguar, was noticeably absent last month from the annual conference of the world economic forum at davos, switzerland, where he had been a fixture for years. \n",
            " the network’s more than 10,000 employees are on edge. the practice of trading positive coverage for cash is so prevalent, many say, that everyone lives in fear that employees who have been detained will reveal details about their colleagues. like others for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the authorities for talking about the continuing investigations. \n",
            " managers hesitate to make big decisions. the move into the new landmark cctv headquarters, which has been mostly empty since its facade was completed in 2008, has stalled, and some high-budget documentary projects have been frozen. \n",
            " executives and producers, afraid of making themselves conspicuous targets, are leaving their luxury cars in their garages. among the top ranks, figuring out how to stop journalists from taking bribes from the people they interview has become a priority, cctv employees said. \n",
            " the turmoil at the network comes at a time when it has become both the spearhead of china’s propaganda efforts in foreign countries and a more expansive global news conduit for an estimated 700 million chinese viewers. \n",
            " “a nation’s tv station is the face for the entire nation,” said wang qinglei, a former producer who worked at cctv from 2003 until he was fired in 2013 for publicly denouncing propaganda on the network. “now this face is dirty and full of mud. there should be a cleansing process to wash it, so the entire nation can be proud again.” \n",
            " the party’s investigations of the network follow two main strands that overlap. one is corrupt business practices, particularly at cctv 2, the financial news channel where mr. rui worked. the other involves the relationships, sometimes intimate, that some party leaders had with anchors and executives at the network, many of whom are also at cctv 2. \n",
            " the widespread gossip about sex between network employees and government officials could not be independently confirmed, but some personal ties are well known. mr. rui, for example, hosted events for gu liping, who is now detained on suspicion of corruption and illicit financial dealings and is the wife of ling jihua, an aide to former president hu jintao. the couple has been placed under investigation. \n",
            " at least one current and one former female cctv anchor who have been detained are being scrutinized for close ties to zhou yongkang, the former security chief and the most senior party official to be arrested in decades for corruption, according to executives and journalists working for cctv and other news institutions. mr. zhou’s second wife, who is a former cctv journalist and is 28 years his junior, has also been detained. \n",
            " li dongsheng, a close associate of mr. zhou and a 22-year employee of cctv, is suspected by investigators of having introduced young women at the network to mr. zhou and other officials for sexual encounters in violation of party rules, the journalists and executives said. when mr. zhou was expelled from the party last december, xinhua, the official state news agency, said he had “committed adultery with a number of women and traded his power for money and sex.” \n",
            " mr. li, who rose to become deputy director of the propaganda department and then vice minister of public security, has been detained since december 2013. \n",
            " the investigations are casting a long shadow over a vast propaganda apparatus with global ambitions. cctv began a big international push around 2008 and now has 70 news bureaus overseas, including a flagship in washington. cctv channels broadcast programming around the world in arabic, english, french, russian and spanish. \n",
            " in 2011, the network started a documentary channel to compete with the kind of high-end programming seen on bbc. it has bought the rights to many foreign documentaries and hired prominent western producers like phil agland. but since the detention last july of the ambitious head of the channel, liu wen, some major projects have been halted, employees said. \n",
            " current and former employees and news media analysts say the revelations, along with a renewed emphasis on propaganda, have further damaged cctv’s credibility. \n",
            " “it is shocking how corrupt the chinese media is,” zhan jiang, a professor of journalism and media studies at beijing foreign studies university, said in a recent online discussion. “it is the most corrupt in the world. to put it bluntly, it is the shame of our country.” \n",
            " cctv declined repeated requests for an interview. \n",
            " mr. wang, the former producer, said he did not think mr. xi’s anticorruption campaigns would cure the ills of the network or china’s one-party system. \n",
            " “this anticorruption campaign is very much a tool of political struggle,” he said. “all it will do is strike down one faction. but the system is not changed in any way.” \n",
            " indeed, the party has taken the corruption investigation as an opportunity to reinforce the network’s propaganda role, ordering up more old-school stories about common chinese and their daily struggles. reporters have been told to emphasize “moral values and social virtues.” \n",
            " “we are now directed to place more emphasis on the common man, farmers and migrant workers,” one journalist said. \n",
            " the corruption that permeated the network had been an open secret for years. at its simplest level, reporters and producers take modest bribes in exchange for positive coverage. journalists typically receive up to $160, known as “red envelopes” or “taxi fare,” as a token of thanks from sources. network employees say much larger fees are sometimes negotiated, according to the type of coverage. \n",
            " several people said one central investigation, involving the anchors and executives of cctv 2, the financial news channel, was focused on large-scale bribetaking as well as ties to corrupt party leaders. mr. rui was the channel’s most famous anchor and had boasted of friendships with former secretary of state henry a. kissinger; former prime minister kevin rudd of australia; and richard c. levin, who was president of yale until 2013. \n",
            " the head of cctv 2, guo zhenxi, was detained last june, a month before mr. rui was. security officers seized mr. rui at the studio on a friday afternoon, leaving an empty co-anchor’s chair that night on his program, “economic news.” \n",
            " when officials decided years ago to make cctv more market-driven, the director of cctv 2 was put in charge of both news programming and business operations, a dual role that offers many opportunities for corruption. “everyone at cctv knows this setup is illogical and unreasonable,” said mr. wang, the former producer. \n",
            " financial irregularities emerged during a six-month audit that was completed last year, mr. wang and others said. \n",
            " information released by state news outlets points to mr. rui’s own mixing of journalism and business as a central part of the case against him. in 2002, he helped found a public relations firm, pegasus communications, that was bought five years later by the american public relations company edelman. mr. rui held stock in pegasus until 2010, according to government documents posted online by a chinese news organization. \n",
            " in 2009 and 2010, while mr. rui was still a part owner of pegasus, the company provided services at davos to cctv 2, mr. rui’s employer, arranging for a studio there, according to an earlier statement from edelman and chinese news reports. \n",
            " corruption takes place in other ways at cctv. budget padding is common, several employees said; people who draw up or approve budgets for productions sometimes request more money than is needed so that they can pocket some of the cash. \n",
            " one senior journalist said he believed the authorities intended for the investigations to be cautionary lessons for other organizations in the news media and beyond. “the crackdown at cctv was designed to create shock waves in society,” he said. \n",
            " at the moment, though, the tumult is greatest at the center. \n",
            " “recently i spoke to another director of programming at cctv, who is leaving,” mr. wang said. “this person told me, ‘each day i spend at cctv is another day i’m spending in shame.’” \n",

            "singapore — almost 400 years ago, as the ming dynasty crumbled under the onslaught of the manchu warriors, a ming prince became a buddhist monk to survive. feigning madness, the exile poured his heartbreak into his ink paintings and came to be known as bada shanren, meaning “mountain man of the great eights.” \n",
            " when meditating one day in 2013, the singaporean artist tan swie hian said, he had a vision of this monk. a buddhist himself, mr. tan etched the 17th-century master into the 21st century in about 60 seconds, in a swoosh of chinese ink on rice paper. “i was in a trance,” said the artist, who is 71 and self-taught. \n",
            " in november, that painting, “portrait of bada shanren,” fetched 20.7 million renminbi, or about $3.3 million, at a poly international auction sale in beijing, cementing mr. tan’s status as the most expensive living artist in southeast asia. the artist broke his own record, which was set in 2012 when his oil and acrylic painting “when the moon is orbed” came under the hammer in beijing for 18.975 million renminbi. it was his first work auctioned in china. \n",
            " what makes mr. tan’s art special, experts say, is that while he is rooted in classic chinese arts and literature, he has equally strong links with western culture — including working in the french embassy in singapore for 24 years before turning to art full time. not unlike singapore itself, he is poised between two worlds, linked to modernity and tradition. his creations reflect the confluence of east and west, borne from his personal and spiritual philosophy. \n",
            " artists, collectors, gallery owners and critics from the region say the fact that a singaporean artist has broken into the chinese auction market is significant. \n",
            " “for a tiny country to have produced an artist of his caliber, recognized internationally, he’s put singapore firmly on the international cultural map,” said tan chai puan, a malaysian culture columnist for lianhe zaobao, a newspaper in singapore. \n",
            " guo yuanchao, poly auction’s modern and contemporary art consultant, said from beijing that chinese collectors were noticing exceptional artists outside china whose works reflect eastern traditions and cultures. while works by the most famous chinese artists command much higher prices, the fact that the first auction of mr. tan’s ink work in china, also by poly auction, saw it selling for a higher price than his oil painting showed the “high recognition chinese collectors accorded to the master,” mr. guo said. \n",
            " victoria huang, who specializes in chinese paintings at bonhams in london, called the auction results “phenomenal,” given that mr. tan had neither a large base of international buyers nor an established auction history at the time. \n",
            " over four decades, mr. tan’s art has taken the form of painting, calligraphy, poetry, sculpture and even stage costume design. he’s not represented by galleries, and his works are mostly with a few private collectors, including tan tien chi, who opened the tan swie hian museum in singapore in 1993. \n",
            " in the closed circles of china’s collectors, mr. tan is an artist in the tradition of ancient scholar literati, “steeped in philosophy, incredibly talented not just in painting, but also calligraphy and poetry,” said ch’ng poh tiong, an art collector and ambassador for the european fine art fair in maastricht, the netherlands. \n",
            " born to ethnic chinese parents in indonesia, mr. tan was educated at the chinese high school in singapore, where he was immersed in the chinese language and literature. after graduating from nanyang university in 1968 with a degree in english language and literature, he found work as press attaché at the french embassy in singapore. there he became fluent in french and ultimately translated the works of the poets henri michaux and jacques prévert into chinese. at 44, mr. tan became the youngest and only southeast asian artist to be elected as a member-correspondent to the academy of fine arts of the institute of france. \n",
            " mr. tan recalled how his colleagues at the embassy had encouraged his artistic pursuits, buying all of the works from his debut solo exhibition, in 1973. eventually, “when i was 49 and had enough savings to sustain my stomach, my human dignity and my creative freedom,” he said, he left the embassy to devote himself to art full time. \n",
            " using the metaphor of brushes to represent the east and west, mr. tan says he wields both brushes simultaneously. “it’s there in everything i do,” he said. \n",
            " in his “portrait of bada shanren,” for instance, the “composition comes from western masters’ works like matisse’s ‘window,”’ mr. tan said. “the brushstrokes,” he added, “remind one of not only liang kai of song dynasty but also antonio saura, the portraitist of modern spain.” \n",
            " pan cheng lui, the editor of shin min daily news in singapore, has covered mr. tan for decades. noting his many international accolades mr. pan said, “his art is not simply eastern, western or southeast asian, but universal.” \n",
            " mr. tan considers himself a son of the 1960s: he had translated aldous huxley’s “the doors of perception” into chinese, enjoyed the music of jimi hendrix and read jack kerouac’s “on the road” and herman hesse’s “siddhartha.” a decade ago, he was among 20 renowned artists (and the only southeast asian artist) invited to collaborate in a charity exhibition with nelson mandela. mr. tan paired images of mandela’s shackled hands with a buddhist “no fear” hand-sign. the work complemented mr. mandela’s sketch of two clenched fists breaking their chains, and both pieces were exhibited in 2005 at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland. \n",
            " mr. tan’s independent character did not always fit well with the conformity of singapore. ho sou ping, founder of the artcommune gallery here, remembered that mr. tan was at loggerheads with some local artists about 20 years ago. \n",
            " “his strong personality is like the durian,” mr. ho said, referring to the fruit with a robust aroma and flavor. “you either like it or you don’t.” \n",
            " as wide ranging as mr. tan’s influences are, his roots remain in his buddhist faith. he said that he experienced a spiritual awakening in 1973 and that the meditative mood had never left him. \n",

            " in less than two years, ms. de castro has built from scratch a business that has generated more than $235,000 in revenue since it was formally established in february 2013, selling watches assembled in cape town. \n",
            " her venture illustrates both the opportunities available in the watch business in south africa and the challenges on a continent with limited watchmaking resources. \n",
            " “i knew nothing about watches,” ms. de castro said in a telephone interview from cape town. “i never wore a watch before because it did not suit my style.” \n",
            " the project was born in an entrepreneurship course at the university of cape town. ms. de castro, then 22, and six classmates were working on a project that required them to come up with a product that was new to south africa, was environmentally sustainable, aimed at a young market segment, and could be brought to market quickly. \n",
            " “we tossed out ideas like making bean-bag beds or charity bracelets, before we agreed to produce bamboo watches,” ms. de castro said. “we wanted a functional object that people felt good about wearing.” \n",
            " within weeks, the team developed the design for a wristwatch featuring a dial made with bamboo strips on a leather strap. with $4,000 in capital, they produced a prototype and placed an order for 500 watches with a chinese factory that they found on the internet. \n",
            " “no one on our team knew anything about watchmaking or distribution,” ms. de castro said. “when the prototype arrived, we showed it to other students on campus, and since everyone loved it, we went ahead with production.” \n",
            " south africa has no watchmaking industry, so ms. de castro and her team looked for most of the components abroad. the dials were made in china, the quartz movements in japan. only the leather straps were made locally in south africa. the final product was marketed as “handcrafted and assembled in south africa.” \n",
            " after graduation, ms. de castro bought out her classmates and registered the company locally as bamboo revolution. determined to make it work, she traveled to china this year and made contact with another, smaller factory that was more responsive to her needs as a small customer. \n",
            " “to develop my business internationally, i had to understand the supply chain, protect my design and control quality standards,” ms. de castro said. “for that, i needed to see the factory and establish a relationship.” \n",
            " last month, she was among 18 finalists, out of 1,600 contenders, in the cartier women’s initiative awards, an annual international business plan competition for women entrepreneurs. the winners receive $20,000 in money, a year of personalized business coaching and a trophy designed by cartier. \n",
            " when the awards were handed out at the women’s forum, a davos-styled gathering of businesswomen in deauville, france, she was not among the five winners. still, stanislas de quercize, chief executive of cartier international, applauded her spirit. \n",
            " “there is opportunity in the current environment to create something new,” mr. de quercize said. “to change the status quo and seize the opportunity, audacity is not a danger, it is the solution.” \n",
            " the challenges faced by ms. de castro are many, including cultural and historical hurdles, wendy luhabe, a south african businesswoman and a member of the cartier awards jury, said in an interview in deauville. \n",
            " “south african culture is not an entrepreneurial culture and people prefer to be employed in a company rather than start a business,” said ms. luhabe, a globally recognized social entrepreneur known for her efforts to empower african women: “historically, south african women have not been a participant in the economy,” she added. “but things are changing.” \n",
            " according to ms. luhabe, ms. de castro’s project was selected among the finalists because she had successfully focused on a niche market to sell a natural product that could be sold using new technologies. \n",
            " “still, we questioned the economic sustainability of ms. de castro’s business,” ms. luhabe said. “we were unsure where she could take the business in five years and how she could protect her design.” \n",
            " few of the skills and resources needed to develop a watchmaking business exist in africa. \n",
            " “it’s our goal to move our production to south africa but there are no resources available here right now,” ms. de castro said. “as we grow, we will try to find ways to have the watch components made locally, but we are not there today.” \n",
            " while many of the top swiss brands have a retail presence in south africa, the luxury watchmakers’ representative group, the fondation de la haute horlogerie, said in an email that it was unaware of any watchmakers on the african continent. \n",
            " the african market for fine watches is limited, to say the least. according to the federation of the swiss watch industry, while switzerland exports 95 percent of its production to all continents, africa accounts for only about 1 percent of those exports by value. in contrast, asia absorbs 53 percent, europe 31 percent and america 14 percent. \n",
            " skilled watchmakers are also rare, although the swiss watchmaking giant swatch group now operates a small training program in johannesburg. the program recruits up to three candidates a year and enrolls them for two years in a watchmaking school that swatch opened in 2008 in malaysia — one of six international schools that it runs, mainly to strengthen its global network of watch repairers. \n",
            " yet, despite the paucity of resources, ms. de castro said, she is determined to expand. in the 21 months of its existence, bamboo revolution has sold 12,000 watches, even making a small profit that she said she had reinvested in the business. \n",
            " “we have sold nearly all of our production to date,” she said. “we currently export to seven countries where we sell through independent distributors via online channels.” \n",
            " those countries includes denmark, sweden, england, iceland, spain, portugal, germany, and soon, australia. \n",
            " at home, the wristwatches are sold at kingdom, a designer clothing and accessories store in the woodstock exchange, an up-market shopping mall just outside cape town’s city center. \n",
            " “our product is in demand and stores are coming to us asking to sell the product but we are selective,” ms. de castro said. “we will expand our online presence because that is where we make our biggest margins,” she added. \n",
            " over the next three years, she said, she plans to develop her watch designs and look for ways to implant her production locally. \n",
            " “perhaps we could send someone from south africa to an international watchmaking school and bring home the necessary skills,” ms. de castro said. “i think that is possible, if we can find the right candidate and the capital.” \n",

            "nations have so dragged their feet in battling climate change that the situation has grown critical and the risk of severe economic disruption is rising, according to a draft united nations report. another 15 years of failure to limit carbon emissions could make the problem virtually impossible to solve with current technologies, experts found. \n",
            " a delay would most likely force future generations to develop the ability to suck greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere and store them underground to preserve the livability of the planet, the report found. but it is not clear whether such technologies will ever exist at the necessary scale, and even if they do, the approach would probably be wildly expensive compared with taking steps now to slow emissions. \n",
            " the report said that governments of the world were still spending far more money to subsidize fossil fuels than to accelerate the shift to cleaner energy, thus encouraging continued investment in projects like coal-burning power plants that pose a long-term climate risk. \n",
            " while the spread of technologies like solar power and wind farms might give the impression of progress, the report said, such developments are being overtaken by rising emissions from fossil fuels over the past decade, especially in fast-growing countries like china. and one of the most important sources of low-carbon energy, nuclear power, is actually declining over time as a percentage of the global energy mix, the report said. \n",
            " unless far greater efforts are made to reduce emissions, “the fundamental drivers of emissions growth are expected to persist despite major improvements in energy supply” and in the efficiency with which energy is used, the report said. \n",
            " the new warnings come in a draft report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change, a united nations panel of climate experts that won the nobel peace prize in 2007 for its efforts to analyze and communicate the risks of climate change. the report is not final, but a draft dated dec. 17 was leaked this week and was first reported by reuters. the new york times obtained a copy independently. \n",
            " business leaders will tackle many of the problems raised in the draft next week, at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, where a day will be devoted to addressing the rising economic costs of climate change — and the costs to businesses and governments of solving the problem. \n",
            " within the business community, “there is an awakening of increasing economic risk — a recognition that operating conditions are changing and we need to respond,” said dominic waughray, head of environmental initiatives for the forum. “there has been a failure of government to address these solutions. if there is an alliance of companies that can bite off pieces of the puzzle, it might help.” \n",
            " in the dry language of a technical committee, the draft outlines an increasingly dire situation. \n",
            " even as the early effects of climate change are starting to be felt around the world, the panel concluded that efforts are lagging not only in reducing emissions, but also in adapting to the climatic changes that have become inevitable. \n",
            " it is true, the report found, that the political willingness to tackle climate change is growing in many countries and new policies are spreading, but the report said these were essentially being outrun by the rapid growth of fossil fuels. \n",
            " while emissions appear to have fallen in recent years in some of the wealthiest countries, that is somewhat of an illusion, the report found. the growth of international trade means many of the goods consumed in wealthy countries are now made abroad — so that those countries have, in effect, outsourced their greenhouse gas emissions to countries like china. \n",
            " emissions in the united states rose slightly in 2013, but are still about 10 percent below their 2005 levels, largely because of the newfound abundance of natural gas, which produces less greenhouse gases than burning coal. \n",
            " the kyoto protocol, an international treaty meant to limit emissions, has “not been as successful as intended,” the report found. that is partly because some important countries like the united states refused to ratify it or later withdrew, but also because of flaws within the treaty itself, the report found. the treaty exempted developing countries from taking strong action, for instance, a decision that many experts now say was a mistake. \n",
            " efforts are underway to negotiate a new international treaty to replace kyoto, but it is not even supposed to take effect until 2020, and it is unclear whether countries will agree on ambitious goals to limit emissions. it is equally unclear how much political support a new treaty will gain in china and the united states, the world’s largest emitters. \n",
            " the obama administration is pushing for a deal, but any treaty would have to be ratified by the senate; many republicans and some coal-state democrats are wary, fearing economic damage to the country. \n",
            " the new report suggests, however, that the real question is whether to take some economic pain now, or more later. \n",
            " nations have agreed to try to limit the warming of the planet to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit above preindustrial levels. even though it will be exceedingly difficult to meet, this target would still mean vast ecological and economic damage, experts have found. but the hope is that these would come on slowly enough to be somewhat manageable; having no target would be to risk catastrophic disruption, the thinking goes. \n",
            " as scientists can best figure, the target requires that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, stay below 500 parts per million. the level recently surpassed 400, and at present growth rates will surpass 500 within a few decades. \n",

            "there still seemed faint hopes of change. a young lawyer, dmitry medvedev, had been handpicked to succeed putin as president at elections a few weeks later (putin, barred by the constitution from serving more than two consecutive terms, would become prime minister). medvedev had pledged to tackle what he called russia’s “legal nihilism”.\n",
            "the three judges left the court to confer. i held a microphone to the bars of the cage and – expecting guards to intervene any moment – managed to conduct one of the few face-to-face interviews since khodorkovsky’s 2005 conviction. i asked him about medvedev’s chances of restoring the rule of law.\n",
            "“tradition, and the state of people’s minds, and the lack of forces that could support any movement towards the rule of law – everything’s against him,” said khodorkovsky, his reedy voice sometimes faltering. “so, may god grant him strength. all we can do is hope.”\n",
            "khodorkovsky was right. today, putin is back as president, pro-democracy protests that flared in winter 2011 have waned; medvedev is yesterday’s man. khodorkovsky is still in jail, found guilty of the new charges in 2010. aleksanyan died in 2011, two years after being released from jail. the rule of law in russia seems in many ways weaker than ever.\n",
            "has ever a businessman experienced such a dizzying ascent to fortune, then such a headlong plunge from grace?\n",
            "khodorkovsky used money from setting up a small business in mikhail gorbachev’s perestroika era to found a bank, menatep, which benefited from big deposits of russian government budget funds. the profits helped buy a stake in yukos in the infamous “loans-for-shares” privatisations of 1995, when the businessmen who would become oligarchs loaned money to a near-bankrupt government and were allowed to buy state assets at knock-down prices. within years, the couple of hundred million dollars he spent gaining control of yukos had become billions.\n",
            "khodorkovsky was the first oligarch to realise the way to real wealth was not by simply selling oil but by adopting western governance standards to boost the yukos share price. he was the first, too, to reinvent himself, like the us robber barons a century earlier, as a philanthropist, launching the non-profit open russia foundation to run educational projects.\n",
            "his fallout with putin had many causes. khodorkovsky dared to confront the president with a thinly veiled allegation of top-level corruption in a televised meeting in february 2003. he tried to build a private oil pipeline to china, contravening state policy. he engaged in aggressive lobbying against increases in oil taxes. he negotiated to sell a stake in yukos to america’s exxonmobil. he was simply too independent. he refused to take his place in the matrix of competing interests and clans, of state and private oligarchs, held in check not by rule of law but, as russians say, po ponyatiyam, “by understandings” – with putin as arbiter.\n",
            "as a prisoner of conscience, khodorkovsky is a flawed figure. he used dubious schemes to squeeze minority shareholders out of yukos; investors who tangled with him are still vitriolic. his philanthropy was motivated partly by a desire for share price-boosting respectability.\n",
            "but never underestimate the redemptive power of a prison term in the russian psyche. russians don’t necessarily feel khodorkovsky is an innocent man. yet they feel he has suffered enough. back in 2008, i felt dostoyevskyan echoes in the tale of the wealthy businessman who clashed with an over-mighty tsar, then purged his soul in the camps. this summer russia’s most respected pollster, the levada centre, found one-third of russians supported his early release; only one in six was against. some 60 per cent thought the real reason he was still in jail was either because freeing him “could cause problems for those who expropriated yukos”, or “because he criticises the government” or because “high-level state officials are personally hostile” to him.\n",
            "freedom may, finally, be in sight. khodorkovsky’s second sentence ends next year and, though a third set of charges to keep him behind bars even longer cannot be ruled out, time to launch them is short. russia may, too, not want the negative publicity as it prepares to host next february’s $50bn winter olympics in sochi. his family are quietly hopeful he will be coming home.\n",
            "but with the 10th anniversary of his arrest on october 25 2003 approaching, i contacted his legal team this summer about a written interview from the segezha prison colony where khodorkovsky is now held in the forests of karelia in northwest russia. two sets of answers popped, weeks later, into my email inbox. the voice from inside the modern-day gulag, frank and thoughtful, was unmistakably his. i asked him first to describe a typical day in what russians call “the zone”. \n",
            "[ft] can you describe a typical day?\n",
            "[khodorkovsky] a long, long, ring of a bell and the night orderly’s bone-chilling roar, “everybody up!” another day begins. another pointless day out of the thousands i’ve already spent, first in prison, and now here in the general regime [low security] colony 100km from the finnish border.\n",
            "young men, 18 to 30 – the main population of “the zone” – leap quickly from their bunks. the inspector can come in immediately after the bell, and if someone’s too slow he’ll end up in solitary. i too get up. i’ve not been asleep for some time already anyway. it’s a habit. half an hour to an hour before reveille is a time when i can be alone with my thoughts, undisturbed. there won’t be another opportunity like that for the rest of the day.\n",
            "ten minutes to shave and wash with cold water, exercises and then the first “formation”. for breakfast. quite a few more times today we’ll have to fall into formation. the canteen is nearby but our walk there is long and slow. that’s “how it’s done”. breakfast is filling and unappetising – porridge, bread. ten minutes and then off to work.\n",
            "again we fall into formation, again a funeral procession, only now to the checkpoint. a body search. the workshop. an empty, huge, cold hangar that has certainly seen better days. we occupy a small corner, where we assemble paper folders. a machine would do this work better but you need to have something to keep the prisoners busy. we get paid $10-$15 a month, “cash in hand”. you can spend it once a week in the local commissary, where that much can get you 1kg-2kg of candy, or four tins of food, or five packs of cigarettes. there’s really not much else. though they do have apples on occasion. i like apples …\n",
            "the bell – “formation”, a search, lunch. fifteen minutes. balanda [a thin gruel] and potatoes. filling, but it’s best not to look at what you’re eating. you might get upset. and do i need that? i’ve had my refuelling, what more do i want?\n",
            "formation, search, the workshop. folders. the bell. the end of the work day.\n",
            "formation, search, the barrack. you can watch tv for an hour. i read or write. nobody bothers me. the bell, formation, supper. potatoes, bread.\n",
            "formation, the barrack. if my lawyers don’t come, i watch the news on the only available channel, and read surrounded by a hundred more inmates. you can have a snack, if you still have anything left from the package your family are allowed to forward to you once every two months. and so passes the day. there are 10 years behind me, and another year still ahead. a long bell and the roar, “lights out!”\n",
            "what are conditions like at the camp?\n",
            "we have “barracks-style” imprisonment – the dormitory isn’t divided up into locked cells. one barrack block holds 100-150 people. it’s warm. rooms inside have ordinary doors without locks.\n",
            "in our room there are 20 people; the floor area is maybe 30-40 square metres. right now the occupancy rate in the camp isn’t high, so most of us (including myself) sleep on the lower bunk. the walls are painted but you can wallpaper them if you so desire. the floors are wooden. this is karelia; there’s plenty of wood.\n",
            "the barracks have ordinary windows. the view is of the neighbouring barrack and the wall between us, topped with barbed wire. there’s a room with a tv and kettles. there are 10 barracks in “the zone”. besides these, there’s a canteen, a school, office facilities, rooms for longer visits, and an industrial zone with workshops – the hangars. beyond the fence, there’s forest. you can see the smokestacks of the cellulose plant.\n",
            "the number of books you can have among your things is restricted – 10 pieces together with magazines. there’s a library but there’s no good literature there, and they don’t allow me to pass books on to it. lawyers order books for me. they take a month to arrive, and then they lie in the storehouse, and i can exchange what i have read once a week. of course, such a regime doesn’t allow you to work with reference books. “e-readers” are banned, as are computers.\n",
            "can you communicate with the outside?\n",
            "there are three ways: telephone calls (up to 15 minutes once a week); letters (they take 7-10 days to get to the lawyers); and orally through my lawyers (but there is official video – and unofficial audio – recording of our meetings).\n",
            "four long visits (of three days each) and six visits of four hours through a glass partition are permitted per year. i get visited by my wife, children and parents but few here are as lucky as me. during the longer visits, you have to spend the whole time in a not very large room or in the kitchen in the common area. this is very difficult for people who have come in from “the outside”. and what can you say about travelling over a thousand kilometres for the sake of four hours through glass? but compared with chita, which my people had to travel 6,500km to reach, this isn’t bad at all. except my parents are not getting any younger …\n",
            "officially, the laundry room in the bathhouse washes things once a week. in a general heap, from socks to undershirts to work clothes. if you want to launder your things in a normal way, you need to get creative. but the problem is then there’s no place to dry them. there’s a communal shower room, where you can bathe once a week. if you work at a dirty production facility, they allow you to take additional showers, after your shift.\n",
            "the colony has its own pigsty, so they do give you the 30-40 grams of meat or lard you’re “entitled” to, adding it to the soup or porridge. you get vegetables – besides potatoes and boiled cabbage – perhaps 10 times a year (cucumbers, onions – things that grow in greenhouses).\n",
            "in the morning there are compulsory exercises for 10 minutes. i always do them; otherwise i’ll certainly strain my back at work. after work we’re allowed to play sport for half an hour to an hour. i usually don’t have the energy but the younger ones play volleyball or “pump themselves up”.\n",
            "we get regular medical examinations, especially for tuberculosis. everything else – except when a person appears to have been beaten – is of little concern to anybody. you need medical attention? knock yourself out trying to get it. they’ll send you to the prison service regional hospital – a pretty sad sight. but if they suspect you have tuberculosis, they send you off to a tuberculosis zone. i’ve not been there but i’ve heard horror stories. \n",
            "the weather’s better here than in krasnokamensk [the siberian camp where khodorkovsky was held from 2005 to 2007]. over there, it was minus 45c in winter and plus 45c in summer, open steppe right to the horizon. here it’s finnish weather: minus 20c or 30c in winter, up to plus 25c in summer.\n",
            "how do inmates treat a former billionaire businessman?\n",
            "the attitude towards me has changed somewhat over these 10 years. in prison they respect age (i’m now older than most people here) and term (10 years is a lot). of course, renown is important, things you can boast about to your acquaintances (“i served time with such-and-such a person!”).\n",
            "everybody’s past is different here, and is rarely discussed. people are more likely to be interested in hearing about a “different life”. and, of course, any substantial fact – opposition to the powers-that-be, non-admission of guilt. this allows those around to talk without fearing possible denunciation.\n",
            "but in general, it’s not difficult for me to find a common language with anyone, besides those i hold in deep contempt. there are people like that here but not many. i’m unable to conceal this feeling, but to overcome my attitude towards rapists, for example, is hard. although they are people too, of course …\n",
            "there are informers here, as in any zone. but this is classified a “red” zone, a model zone, so there’s a particularly large number of informers. there are sometimes whole queues lined up to see the prison staff. what do they tell them about? about minor violations, as a rule. real or imaginary. someone was talking while in formation, someone refused to do clean-up, someone was smoking at an inappropriate time, things like that.\n",
            "ratting is a useful thing: you can get some kind of privilege, such as permission to wear “outside” [civilian] shoes, you can increase your “authority” among the prisoners and even extort various things. but there are risks as well, since someone can also rat on you, they can beat you up during a staging [transport between institutions] or even kill you. such things do happen, albeit rarely.\n",
            "i’ve not observed any kind of particular cruelty in the camps and the prisons. if anything, it’s less dangerous here than on the outside, since people usually don’t drink and don’t have access to drugs.\n",
            "nobody needs problems. but they do happen (since many people here are the kind who don’t think with their heads), when people receive the command to “punish”; it’s not important whether it comes from their colleagues or from the administration. for privileges or some miserable pittance of a reward. the consequences can be very serious. i’ve observed it more than once. otherwise, in ordinary camp life, people are all sufficiently restrained. although, as in any male collective, there are clashes. but without cruelty. just throwing a few punches around.\n",
            "the administration employees, as opposed to the guards, are right among the prisoners, on the camp territory and unarmed. there are only truncheons and handcuffs. but i don’t think i’ve ever seen them used in my presence.\n",
            "in this model camp, the employees come to work sober. in krasnokamensk, and in other camps as well, the situation is different. they speak politely with adults here. with me they even use the russian formal “you” – “vy”. with younger people – it depends, but boorishness and humiliating treatment are a rarity. in general, if you want to stand up for your dignity, you have got to be ready to fight and to suffer losses. just like everywhere else.\n",
            "how had prison life changed khodorkovsky? he told me it had made him more restrained, slower to rush to conclusions. he was more tolerant of human weaknesses and mistakes (a quality some yukos employees say he lacked in his go-getting heyday) but quicker to cut people off “if they cross the line”. (in prison, “softness is not understood and not excused.”) i asked him more about his life.\n",
            "what can you read in the camp?\n",
            "i find it important not to lose ties with the reality beyond the fence. every day i try to read 100-200 pages of informational materials sent by my lawyers, the many newspapers and magazines to which i subscribe. as a rule, i manage. i’m a fast reader. but then very little time is left for all other literature. it was easier in prison. it was there i began to delve into history and philosophy. and also, for recreation, i read historical fantasy. an absolutely wonderful genre, in my view.\n",
            "do you fear the authorities will bring a third set of charges against you? and how do you cope mentally with not knowing exactly when you will leave prison? do you suffer bouts of depression?\n",
            "i know there are those trying to convince vladimir putin to do this; if the “command” is given, there’ll be a “case” and a conviction. the storyline the prosecution presents hardly matters. i personally don’t fear prison. i’ve become accustomed to it. i do fear for my family, my parents, my children.\n",
            "in 2007, when i received the completely nonsensical charge of having stolen all of yukos’s oil, i forced myself to come to terms with the notion of endless imprisonment. when president putin declared in 2012 that i would get out after having sat out this term, it was hard to believe him.\n",
            "so now, if he “changes his mind”, this will be tough for me, of course, but it’s not going to drive me to depression. i’m not the only russian prisoner who’s had to learn to live with uncertainty about the time of his release.\n",
            "you told a russian journalist that if you’d known 10 years ago what would happen to you, you would have killed yourself. were you serious? you could have left russia before you were arrested …\n",
            "[she] asked me not about the arrest, for which i was prepared, and not even about imprisonment, but about if i’d known everything straight away: about the death of vasily aleksanyan, the hostages [arrests of yukos employees to put pressure on senior executives on trial], the forced emigrations. about the demolition of the company, the demolition of my illusions about the judiciary, about the powers-that-be (and i did have them), and so on. i wasn’t prepared for that kind of knowledge then. everything’s different now. perhaps the prison experience has helped me survive the sense of personal responsibility. had i left the country, i would have “eaten myself alive”.\n",
            "what was the hardest of all those things to bear?\n",
            "when you are getting your fingers smashed with a hammer, which one hurts the most? perhaps the first one. but more likely it comes in waves: it seems you’ve got used to it, and then suddenly the pain comes again. but after five years the acuteness of perception declines. no question.\n",
            "how do you feel about the economist sergei guriev, who participated in an experts’ report that criticised the second case against you, and felt compelled to flee russia this year?\n",
            "i consider the situation with sergei guriev to be typical of russia’s way of “applying the law”. but that doesn’t make it any less revolting. the yukos chief counsel, vasily aleksanyan (guriev made reference to him), did indeed pay first with his health and freedom, and then with his life, for refusing to bear false witness. such offers, backed by threats of unlawful persecution, were made to many who worked at yukos, including foreign citizens. i personally read one such interrogation record.\n",
            "these were striking statements from a man who in his months sitting in defendants’ cages seemed to possess extraordinary inner calm. i switched track, to ask about russia’s system, and the nascent russian opposition, including alexei navalny, the charismatic protest leader. last month navalny finished second in elections for moscow mayor but, like khodorkovsky, was convicted this summer of dubious embezzlement charges.\n",
            "for you, what is putinism?\n",
            "putinism is authoritarian state capitalism based around one leader. it’s an attempt to control society and the state apparatus through kompromat [“dirt” about a person used to keep them in line], and through arbitrary law enforcement. it’s the consistent annihilation of the substance of independent state and civic institutions. it’s an attempt to run a huge country in “manual mode”. that’s no way to build a modern country.\n",
            "what do you say to those who suggest the roots of putinism lie in the 1990s; that the way the “oligarchs” abused the political and judicial system in part paved the way for today’s system?\n",
            "it’s hard to speak to naive people who believe in myths by the name of [boris] berezovsky [one of the most flamboyant 1990s oligarchs, who later fled russia and died this year]. the “oligarchs” had significant influence only in berezovsky’s head and in myths created by him.\n",
            "the so-called oligarchs never had a fraction of the power over the judicial and law enforcement system that putin’s circle has today. even if we take just the economy and compare, for example, yukos and rosneft [the state-controlled oil giant that bought many yukos assets], the scale of their influence on the state apparatus is incomparable. \n",
            "until the beginning of the 2000s we were building a democratic state, with all its early-stage shortcomings. the us in the 1930s to the 1950s provides some very similar examples. from 2001 on – and especially after the yukos affair began – an analogy to early fascist spain is closer: “to my friends, everything; to my enemies, the law.” the fork in the road is obvious.\n",
            "but didn’t the fact that a few people made billions in the 1990s while most people’s living standards plunged contribute to popular disillusionment with “democracy” and “capitalism” that persists to today?\n",
            "the origins of the putin regime can be found in 1993, when the chechen war started, when separation of powers was eliminated and the president received dictatorial powers. it was at this moment that we made a mistake.\n",
            "in those years i spent a lot of time out in the regions; i worked side by side with ordinary workers on drilling rigs and in the oil fields; at times we even ate “from the same pot”. for them, the question of who owned the business was not relevant. and in general, for residents of a small town the difference between me and [president boris] yeltsin was not very significant – we were all just “the bosses”.\n",
            "what really worried them was whether these “bosses” could guarantee a job and a salary, whether they knew how to talk to people, to listen and to hear. even in terms of consumption, nobody compared themselves with the “oligarchs” in faraway moscow – only with local entrepreneurs, those who lived nearby, in the flat or house next door. despite all the aggressive propaganda about social discord, i never had any problems in my relations with people.\n",
            "that doesn’t mean that privatisation could not have been conducted more fairly, in the interests of a greater number of citizens. it definitely could and should have been. however, when we offered to correct the situation through a compensatory tax, it turned out that the powers-that-be were interested in maintaining the antagonism. our project was buried.\n",
            "the idea of capitalism in russia is alive and well today but, as for liberal democracy, they have indeed made a bogeyman out of it, ascribing to it all the costs of poor-quality authoritarian governance. explaining this to people will take a lot of work on our part.\n",
            "how do you answer russians who, initially at least, used to say “khodorkovsky got what he deserved”?\n",
            "it’s hard to feel sorry for a rich person. this is hardly something unique to russians. but it’s hard to convince people that what you “deserve” needs to be established by an independent court, and not by envious people and a flunky of your opponents. it’s gradually getting through to people that complete lawlessness towards a powerful person will turn into even greater and wider-scale lawlessness in relation to ordinary people. not for nothing has a fair judiciary now come to the forefront of society’s demands.\n",
            "do you believe russia’s “managed” democracy could evolve into something more “real”? or will it require a new revolution?\n",
            "i’d like to believe in the path of reforms. there are people in putin’s circle who are attempting to get a civic dialogue going, as we can see from moscow and yekaterinburg [where opposition candidates were allowed to participate in mayoral elections in september]. but the siloviki [hardliners around vladimir putin] are more influential for now. \n",
            "putin doesn’t have much time left – five to 10 years, maximum. any powerful crisis, given the current state of state institutions and dialogue with society, could result in the bounds of the current system being breached.\n",
            "how do you believe the next handover of power will occur?\n",
            "of course i’d like it if vladimir putin were to gradually divide presidential power between an honestly elected parliament, an independent judiciary and a coalition government, and a new president became a compromise figure, not an authoritarian one, the guarantor of citizens’ rights. the likelihood that events will develop that way is sadly not high. more realistic, after putin leaves, is a brief period of rule by the new “heir”, and then an inevitable political crisis and a “relaunch” of how the country is run, a shift to a constituent assembly.\n",
            "we’ve seen a clampdown on opposition and civil society since putin returned as president. will people just submit, or will it lead eventually to a new explosion?\n",
            "it’s possible – though not very likely – that vladimir putin will keep the screws tightened until the end of his rule [another presidential term could take him to 2024] though i think he’ll leave earlier than that. however, as the quality of the administrative class declines, the protest potential that has already built up – and this tendency is growing among the youth – makes a political crisis practically inevitable. the “purging” of the political “field”, the curtailing of social mobility, the ageing of putin and his entourage, the inner circle’s way of running things by arbitrating constant conflicts between them, the refusal to engage in dialogue with society, all create a powerful breeding ground for politicians and radicals from outside the current system.\n",
            "to what extent do you think the protests since winter 2011 reflect a clash of generations between the soviet and “post-soviet” generation?\n",
            "i’d say the division is different – between people who feel fully dependent on the state or its bureaucracy, and independent people, ready to take responsibility for their own fate. of course there’s more of a feeling of independence in the post-soviet generation but there’s nevertheless no clear dividing line. most likely it’s a question of individual personality traits. the main thing i like about the “dissenters” is their sense of their own self-worth, which sometimes comes to a person only in later years. and this is remarkable!\n",
            "despite his conviction, do you believe alexei navalny could be a future russian leader?\n",
            "there’s no doubt alexei navalny has the ambitions and charisma of a leader. however, if he wants to base himself on the independently thinking part of society, then as well as building up management experience, he’ll definitely have to demonstrate he refuses simply to perpetuate authoritarian-type leadership. but that’s not at all easy.\n",
            "still, i think the path to being [putin’s] “heir” is closed to him. he’s a stranger to today’s elite. will navalny be able to – will he want to – offer a version of democratic leadership? assuming the situation develops peacefully, his political prospects depend on the answer to that question.\n",
            "do you mean you’re concerned about navalny’s nationalist links? could rule by navalny lead to nationalism?\n",
            "i consider alexei navalny a fairly reasonable person, so i don’t expect nationalism or chauvinism from him. but at the same time, turning away from strong-man rule demands a lot more ideological fortitude. many supporters of any popular russian politician long to see in him a strong-man leader. and what happens is unlimited presidential powers and yet another round of authoritarianism.\n",
            "navalny, unlike khodorkovsky, recently had his five-year jail term commuted to a suspended sentence that nonetheless bars him from public office. but since putin’s return as president last year, the ex-yukos boss has been joined by other “political” prisoners including members of the punk band pussy riot, and protesters who clashed with police last year. i asked him finally what the west could do – and what he would do when he got out.\n",
            "how can europe and the us usefully respond to what’s happening in russia?\n",
            "i’m convinced the current regime’s legitimacy in many ways rests upon its recognition by the west. i think the west should recognise only state institutions that really do exist, and clearly renounce simulacra like the dependent courts and the pseudo-parliament. but in conversations – with the president, his administration, state corporations – it’s imperative to strive for recognition of all european values, or at least a part, as the basis for co-operation. otherwise, as experience has shown, peaceful coexistence on our continent will not last long.\n",

            "i think that with another approach, a country as endowed with raw materials as we are and with our low – by european measures – level of consumption and quality of infrastructure could show not 2 per cent but 6 to 7 per cent growth rates for another decade or two, and attain canadian quality-of-life indicators.

            "the star turn at the world economic forum in davos on wednesday belongs to dmitry medvedev, the russian prime minister, who will once again try to convince sceptical business people why they should invest in his country, writes stefan wagstyl.\n",
            "it will be the third such appearance by a russian leader in davos in just five years. there’s not much chance that the foreign investors’ views will change that much – but medvedev is likely to have interesting things to say about russia’s $10bn privatisation programme. meanwhile, here, below the break, is a guest post from his wef hosts, spelling out russia’s economic challenges.\n",
            "by stephan mergenthaler and andrew d. bishop\n",
            "the russian economy has had a great run over the past decade, as evidenced by its seven-fold increase in gdp per capita between 2000 and 2011 and the ensuing consumption boom that has spurred investment in sectors ranging from information technology to retail. yet despite this impressive growth story, the factors that underpinned russia’s economic development over the past ten years are fraught with growing uncertainty.\n",
            "as the world economic forum’s scenarios for the russian federation published highlights, russia’s economy has grown substantially over the past years, but it has also grown increasingly fragile.the country has missed an opportunity to use the large energy windfalls of the past decade to reform its institutional environment and make itself more resilient to future shocks by nurturing a dynamic and diversified economic base.\n",
            " instead, energy revenues have mostly served russia to balance its institutional shortcomings, indicating an increasingly unsustainable path to the future.\n",
            "corruption has gone unabated in the country despite a significant increase in gdp, while growing spending on an ever-larger government apparatus has failed to improve the delivery of public services in sectors ranging from health to infrastructure (see charts).\n",
            "in part because of this, popular discontent has been on the rise regardless of the increasing material comfort enjoyed by the country’s growing middle class, and capital outflows have accelerated.\n",
            "while the near-continuous rise in oil prices over the past decade helped stabilize the russian economy in spite of these shortcomings, high oil prices are never set in stone. there is growing evidence that energy abundance may become the new dominant paradigm and not merely in the united states,where the shale gas revolution is already transforming global energy markets. europe’s and china’s shale gas reserves could provide them with a significantly enhanced negotiating position and make it increasingly difficult for russia to sustain its high export revenues (see chart).\n",
            " exploiting these and other new resources could lead to a substantial, if progressive,decline in global oil prices. a quick glance at the world’s leading energy demand and oil price projections supports this concern for russia, pointing to a highly uncertain future for the fossil fuels upon which the country’s current economic model is so dependent (see chart).\n",
            "but even if oil prices remain high, russia risks failing to capitalise on its energy potential. the country critically needs to upgrade investments in its production capacities in order to move beyond ailing legacy fields and exploit untapped potential in less accessible areas including the arctic. it also needs to adapt its business relationships and supply infrastructure in order to capitalise on new demand centres in the far east and compete ina tough global lng market.\n",
            "achieving these goals requires greater competition in domestic markets and a more reliable institutional environment that supports innovation and long-term investments. but if these adjustments appear difficult to proceed with in times of growth, they will be near-impossible to implement in times of crisis.\n",
            "russia’s predominant focus on oil and gas also easily masks significant sources of opportunity. for instance, a strategic move would be for the country to exploit its abundant natural resources beyond oil and gas to benefit from its rich land, water and food supplies in a context of increasing global resource scarcity. one way this could be facilitated would be through increased support to be given to russia’s diverse and promising regions. recent elections have indeed shown that their initiatives, often independent of the central government, are more than ever catalysing hopes in business and politics alike.\n",
            "to fully exploit the potential of its economy, it is clear that russia needs to address these reforms in a structural fashion. given the tight interplay between energy revenues, institutional reforms and the country’s social cohesion, piecemeal approaches are bound to disappoint. the most promising way for russia to thrive in a drastically changing world is for the country to develop institutions open and flexible enough to face the forces reshaping its future both within and beyond its borders.\n",

            "he said he didn't like considering it as a question of austerity versus growth. fiscal consolidation is unavoidable.\n",
            " \n",
            "there cannot be any sustainable growth with endless collection of debt.\n",
            "but we must admit that fiscal consolidation is contractionary in the short term.\n",
            " \n",
            "the question is not growth vs austerity. the question is how we mitigate the short-term affect of consolidation.\n",
            "draghi makes three proposals:\n",
            "1) do the consolidation in a way that stimulates exports so you dampen the consolidation through more exports and job creation.\n",
            "2) many governments usually implement these plans under a sense of \"stress and urgency\", the stress of markets and with interest rates moving sharply upwards. thus, they raise taxes and cut spending.\n",
            "that \"can be justified\" at the time, draghi says, but:\n",
            "when the panic subsides, you would want to see \"curbs to cuts in spending\", reductions in tax rises, and increased investment in infrastructure.\n",
            "3) hesitation in undertaking fiscal consolidation doesn't pay. it's actually very very costly, says draghi.\n",

            "on the edge of copenhagen, a calico pig hung from its hind legs under an enormous red tent. some 600 off-duty chefs and their groupies watched from the bleachers as operatic butcher dario cecchini, in from panzano, italy, grabbed a knife. \"this is the stomach of the world,\" he said, pointing to the pig. he cut a vertical slit down the belly of the beast and removed the heart, lungs, liver and intestines. \"we are carnivores,\" he said, \"but we must be conscientious carnivores. we have to have respect for the gift of meat the animal has given us. and that begins with the stomach, that begins with the guts.\" when he'd finished disemboweling the pig, mr. cecchini took a bow. the audience went wild with applause. the third annual mad symposium had officially begun.\n",
            "a food movement is brewing in denmark, and it's got nothing to do with the foraged berries and herbs the world has come to associate with new nordic cooking. at the mad symposium (\"mad\" is danish for \"food\"), tastemakers from around the globe convened in copenhagen last month, as they had the previous two summers, with one goal: to move the conversation about food beyond the pampered search for pleasure. for marquee chefs and the writers who cover them, the yearly gathering has fast become the must-attend event of the year. it's a party with a sense of purpose, a place to learn from big thinkers, a bacchanal pushing world-changing views. you might say it's become the davos of food.\n",
            "the theme this year was \"guts\"—in every sense of the word. co-curated by new york-based chef david chang and mad founder rené redzepi, chef-owner of copenhagen's noma, the two-day event boasted a packed roster of speakers. most shared stories of courage. somali chef ahmed jama spoke of the challenges of opening a restaurant in a war zone. to thundering applause, african-american food historian michael twitty talked of reviving slave cuisine. the audience heard from a novelist and a climate scientist, an indian \"seed activist\" and an aboriginal guide, and haute-cuisine legend alain ducasse—iconoclasts who've all forged their own paths.\n",
            "\"where are all the women chefs?\" wondered chef margot henderson, wife of fergus henderson, the british nose-to-tail pioneer. and 10-year-old martha payne, too terrified to utter a single word, stood with her dad as he told the story of her viral blog, neverseconds, which turned the sorry state of the british school lunch into a world-wide cause célèbre. \"we love you, martha!\" screamed the crowd.\n",
            "mad is a new kind of food festival, open to anyone who can swing a ticket—it sold out immediately this year—but designed by and for chefs. unlike most high-profile food shindigs, there are no corporate sponsors and no cooking demos. mad is about exchanging ideas.\n",
            "\"we wanted it to be more of an inspirational thing,\" said mr. redzepi, \"not just, 'here are my latest seven creations.'\" the idea began four years ago with a conversation between mr. redzepi and mr. chang, after a long day together at cook it raw, another, much more exclusive chef gathering. \"we were saying, 'why do we go to all these festivals, get shoved around for big sponsorship deals?'\" recalled mr. redzepi. they dreamed of an alternative, a sort of independent clubhouse where they could meet with their peers.\n",
            "baseline funding came from a new government agency, branding denmark, established to rehabilitate the country's image after the furor over political cartoons mocking the prophet muhammad (a portion of the agency's budget was earmarked to promote danish gastronomy). at this year's symposium, which cost some $600,000 to produce, local brewer mikkeller donated six different beers made specially for mad. twenty women from souk el tayeb, a beirut farmers' market, made lunch for 600 the first day, while danny bowien and his crew from the mission chinese food restaurants in san francisco and new york prepared the feast on the second. if branding denmark's mission is to promote a more cosmopolitan and tolerant image of the nation, its investment in mad would appear to be a sound one.\n",
            "with mr. chang and the editorial team from his quarterly food journal, lucky peach, helping out, the latest mad became a referendum on celebrity chefs and their responsibility to do something worthy with their spotlight. chris ying, the magazine's editor in chief, organized a study on the restaurant world's carbon footprint, which inspired mr. redzepi to convert noma to renewable wind power.\n",
            "and the mad mandate is expanding. the new mad feed blog will explore big ideas in food year round. and mad mondays, a lecture series launched last year, will continue to bring the spirit of the symposium to the copenhagen public. there's talk of hosting simultaneous talks in other countries as well. \"our trade is changing,\" said mr. redzepi. \"chefs are invited to do ted talks, they're invited to the white house. mad is an attempt to make sense of all that.\"\n",

            "jump-starting the world economy will be a central topic of discussion among world leaders meeting for the next few days at the world economic forum in davos.\n",
            "many of the business leaders in davos lead large global companies. however, you cannot talk about growth, jobs, and innovation without talking about small and medium-sized enterprises and how they can contribute to getting the world economy back on track.\n",
            "when the oil price shocks of the 1970s triggered recessions in europe and north america, a shakeout ensued among large industrial firms, sweeping away venerable giants like british leyland and penn central.\n",
            "the same thing happened again during the tech-led sharemarket crash of 2000 to 2002, which triggered the collapse of such institutions as bethlehem steel, sunbeam and swissair. each time, as the global economy rebounded, the charge was led by small start-ups, many of which have developed into the business giants of today.\n",
            "some of the world’s most familiar products, things we take for granted – such as aeroplanes, lightbulbs, television sets and personal computers – started off as inventions by independent entrepreneurs and small-business owners. both the technology giant united technologies and computer powerhouse hewlett-packard started their lives as small companies during the great depression.\n",
            "growth does not stem exclusively from smes, but there are compelling reasons why so much of the innovation that underlies growth can be traced to them.\n",
            "john stuart mill once wrote that the main advantage of smaller businesses is that they run by “individual management” rather than numerous investors. this means they benefit from “the much keener interest of the managers in the success of the undertaking.”\n",
            "that “keen interest” often means that smes develop new technologies, innovative business models and distinctive marketing strategies significantly faster than large global enterprises.\n",
            "in the united states and other developed markets, smes commonly account for half or more of gross domestic product, as opposed to less than 30 per cent elsewhere. a recent study from the european commission indicates that smes generated 85 per cent of all new jobs in the european union from 2002 to 2010. in germany, almost all of the 1.8m new jobs created during the last 5 years came from smes.\n",
            "this is “the power of small” – as we like to call it.\n",
            "as we seek to revitalise the global economy, we must again look to small and medium-sized businesses to drive a significant proportion of innovation to fuel growth.\n",
            "unfortunately, these same companies are now experiencing a more painful slump than large enterprises. according to a recent report, small businesses in china say they are faced with “the toughest time in history.” only 33 per cent of surveyed small businesses in china were producing at full capacity and up to 27 per cent were working at half capacity this year. in the us, the wells fargo-gallup small business index poll found that, looking ahead to 2012, approximately one in three small-business owners said they are worried about going out of business.\n",
            "one reason smaller enterprises have difficulty competing in a downturn is a shortage of access: access to clients, funding and talent. for instance, in india, many smes are started by entrepreneurs returning to the country after stints in the us. 86 per cent of them report using personal savings. 90 per cent of innovative smes in germany use their own financial resources.\n",
            "when business activity declines, the remaining transactions are more likely to be channelled to the biggest players in the marketplace. caution impels bankers to limit their exposure to borrowers with shallower pockets, and buyers of goods and services tend to opt for the suppliers they consider the least risky to deal with.\n",
            "how can information and communications technology change this equation? one way is by eliminating the shortage of information that often drives lenders, buyers and jobseekers to the best-known firms.\n",
            "information imbalances are a well-understood phenomenon in the study of economics. but modern business data analytics and the rise of the internet have been steadily eroding these imbalances. the spread of technologies like in-memory and mobile computing are putting comprehensive data tools in the hands of decision-makers everywhere.\n",
            "and the eventual result will be to eliminate the brand awareness disadvantages that currently hamper smes. by taking a real-time view of risks and analysing all available data, bankers can now consistently base loan decisions on fundamentals as opposed to secondary factors such as company size or public recognition. potential customers can choose their suppliers based on strict criteria of quality and reliability rather than on brand awareness. smes can attract top talent from the best schools – if young jobseekers have access to comprehensive data on where their skill sets might best be put to use.\n",
            "connectedness can also benefit the small business owner or entrepreneur. one of the major challenges for an sme owner is access to expert advice and collaboration when needed. by taking advantage of the web as a community, increasingly nimble enterprises can now co-ordinate their requirements for expertise and collaboration in a manner that resembles that of online social networks. these “business webs” can generate vast benefits in the form of mentoring and advice and ultimately deliver advanced business services like treasury and transportation management to enable scale – while the sme focuses on its core business.\n",
            "at the same time, mobile business activities are growing rapidly in volume. mobile connectivity for small businesses – ultimately offering access to some 6bn consumers – will really enable them to grow.\n",
            "for instance, in the uk, a new breed of small business has been nicknamed “the tots” (twelve-months-old, optimistic, and technologically-minded). these businesses are growing faster than the average start-up and are increasing their revenues with speed. one of the tots’ weapons is a heavy reliance on mobile technology. some 98 per cent depend on smartphones to execute routine business activities.\n",
            "policymakers worldwide also have a role to play. they need to help smes by streamlining regulations and making it easier to do business. existing government regulations and uncertainty about future regulations are among small business owners’ top concerns. according the to the us small business administration, small firms in the united states spend $2,830 more per employee annually than larger firms to comply with government regulations. the costs associated with compliance are steadily rising.\n",
            "large enterprises can offer help to smes as well. for example, many large companies have money to invest in venture funds. they can also provide mentoring to sme owners. large technology companies have the ability to create open platforms for co-innovation and collaboration with smes, as well as online communities for discussion. most importantly, large enterprises can add scale to inventions created by smes. with the right business model and partnership, both the sme and the large enterprise can benefit from the combination of invention and scale, which is ultimately the definition of innovation.\n",
            "small businesses start with dreams – typically one person’s dream. these dreams become reality through hard work and innovation. more than ever today, we need to be prepared to go the extra mile to enable and strengthen them. we need the power of small to get the world’s economy back on track.\n",

            "in the year since the last meeting in davos, a civilian surge has rocked the middle east in the name of democracy, human rights and personal dignity. \n",
            "it is a striking paradox, therefore, to hear such a chorus of concern about decisive leadership from within the democratic world. \n",
            "europe has provided the paradigm case. the longer the euro crisis has dragged on, the more expensive and dangerous it has become. but the dysfunctions of democracy are the political story in the us, japan and india, as well as europe. \n",
            "some of the reasons have been well documented: the hyper-connected nature of the modern world; the clash between national politics and international problems, and between short-term electoral timetables and longer-term policy cycles; the disorientation that comes from seismic shifts in economic power; the growing resource crunch; and the demands of 24/7 news media.\n",
            "the past decade has seen the rise of an asymmetric world in which a non-state organisation such as al-qaeda can convulse the world’s superpower; one in which leaderless protesters can oust their national leader; and where one of the smallest countries in the middle east, qatar, can become a key player by virtue of its soft power. it is a world in which china and india will have huge economies, but low per capita incomes.\n",
            "these are the two faces of globalisation. the dynamism of democratisation on the one hand, and the instability that arises from the collapse of historic authority structures on the other. this year’s davos will be dominated by questions of governance – the balance of power, the future of the us superpower and the fate of the european experiment in shared sovereignty. \n",
            "but in order to address the challenges of our time, we need to consider three main issues. \n",
            "first, the power of the people. every government in the world today is in a coalition with its people – the bar for the legitimate exercise of power has been raised. \n",
            "almost every problem requires strategic leadership from government, innovation from the private sector and the mobilisation of citizens. every policy solution needs to be one that has emotional and rational resonance with the people it seeks to help. \n",
            "the people will not remain leaderless for long, and if political and business leaders do not provide that leadership, they will be cast aside.\n",
            "second, the power of cities. in the great reset, economist richard florida reports that 40 urban mega-regions around the world account for 60 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product and 85 per cent of technological innovation. yet they account for only 18 per cent of the world’s housing (a proxy for population).\n",
            "these metropolises are international players in their own right. they are laboratories of progress, risk-takers with global significance, because they are the places that bring people, money and ideas together. \n",
            "third, the power of countries that are regional or sub-regional locomotives of social and economic progress – and pivots for political advances. turkey clearly aspires to play this role in the middle east. the sub-regions of the african continent depend on leadership from south africa, kenya and nigeria. \n",
            "these countries combine hard and soft power. they are plugged into the networks that matter, they generate ideas that can make a difference, and they are independent of the superpowers, existing or emerging, while maintaining good connections to them.\n",
            "in his book, the growth map, jim o’neill lists the new 11 economies that will follow the four brics he identified 10 years ago. these are countries such as bangladesh, south korea and the philippines that have the potential to be the fastest-growing countries, at scale, in the next decade. \n",
            "this asymmetric world should suit a country such as britain. we will never again have a \n",
            "globally significant population size or claim a global empire, but, through institutions such as the bbc, we generate ideas – and have the power to engage others with them. \n",
            "last year, david cameron, the prime minister, spoke about “optimism” and “confidence” at davos. yet the economic recovery in britain has nosedived and we have withdrawn to the sidelines of europe. \n",
            "i hope that in the year when the world will be watching britain during the olympic and paralympic games, there is space to sort rhetoric from reality. \n",

            "is 2012 asia’s year? many would argue its relative economic success could offer lessons for the rest of the world, particularly in the face of what has been widely perceived as western financial mismanagement and incompetence. \n",
            "in 2007, the housing crisis in the us provided the spark for the global economic meltdown, and now there are fears that europe’s tinder is looking particularly dry. asia, in contrast, offers relative economic stability – and opportunities for growth.\n",
            "one primary lesson for underperforming western nations is in how asia has embraced regionalisation even as it increasingly believes itself to be the victim of globalisation. \n",
            "“asian regional co-operation has a lot of opportunities to grow and expand,” said li wei, president of the research arm of china’s state council at a recent forum in hong kong. “[that way we] are also better protected from a financial crisis.”\n",
            "since the crisis of 1997-98, asia has moved rapidly into a recovery, with the foreign reserves of many countries across region increasing to impressively healthy levels. \n",

            "with all 10 major countries in the region now rated at this level, their improving fundamentals are in marked contrast to the deteriorating picture in countries such as italy or greece.\n",
            "however, the notion of decoupling – an asia independent of economic movements in the west – has yet to become a reality. asia’s welfare continues to depend on exports to the developed markets of europe and the us, as well as to each other. when developed markets falter, asian markets plummet. \n",
            "“we are being punished for the sins of others,” says gerard lee, chief executive of singapore-based lion global investors. “we fall more.”\n",
            "dissatisfaction has grown as the relationship between the west and asia has come under greater scrutiny, and intensified with the introduction of quantitative easing in the us. bader al-saad, head of the kuwait investment authority, and gao xiqing, president of china investment corporation, have both repeatedly spoken out about what they see as the irresponsible behaviour of monetary officials and politicians. \n",
            "in a speech last year in new york, the widely respected mr al-saad went one step further, stating he no longer considers treasury securities the only truly risk-free security. in addition, mr gao had earlier said that if he had one message for the us federal reserve, it would be that when it prints money, it must realise there are consequences for the whole world.\n",
            "might that discontent change the pattern of capital flows? one senior official at an investment arm of the singapore government says that, over time, asia should stop giving its savings to western banks and governments. \n",
            "“it would be better for asia to intermediate its own savings,” he says. “it would make asia more resilient.” these comments are not isolated. fear of a credit crunch, as european banks pull out of south-east asia in particular, has intensified such talk. asia also blames the west – and increasing globalisation – for the ills that come with development, particularly rising income inequality. \n",
            "yet despite the region’s return to relative health, there are still geopolitical factors that could undermine its much-vaunted economic and political independence. china, for example, has become increasingly assertive in disputes with its neighbours, pushing many countries to look once more to the us to guarantee regional security.\n",

            " if there was a single moment that crystallized mrs. murdoch’s ascendancy in the public imagination, it was during her husband’s testimony last july before a british parliamentary subcommittee over the widespread phone hacking that happened at one of his newspapers, the news of the world. wearing a pink blazer, she sat behind him, then instinctively vaulted out of her chair to protect her husband from a protester’s pie attack. \n",
            " “until the cream-pie incident, she’d really been branded the classic younger wife with a tinge of racism and stereotyping,” said andrew butcher, a former senior communications executive at news corporation. “that turned everything around for her.” \n",

            " friends said they were not surprised at all to see mrs. murdoch, a former competitive volleyball player, jump to her husband’s defense. “nothing characterizes her more than that moment,” said diane von furstenberg, a longtime friend whose husband, barry diller, worked for mr. murdoch. “she is protective and fierce and not afraid of anything.” \n",
            " sally shan, a managing director of harbourvest partners, a global private equity firm, and mrs. murdoch’s roommate when they attended the yale school of management, said, “i saw that and thought, that’s my wendi.” \n",
            " if wendi deng murdoch had not married the world’s most powerful media mogul, her life would probably read like an idealized version of the american immigrant story. \n",

            " after liz smith announced in the new york post in 1998 that mr. murdoch and his wife of 31 years, anna, had amicably separated, the company crafted a widely accepted narrative that mr. murdoch and wendi deng met later, after he and anna were already separated, when ms. deng accompanied mr. murdoch on a trip to beijing. \n",
            " in reality, they met months earlier during a town-hall-style session at star tv, according to a person who was close to mr. murdoch at the time. employees, gathered in the company’s glistening new kowloon headquarters in hong kong, lobbed mostly softball questions at mr. murdoch. then ms. deng stood up. \n",
            " “why is your china strategy so bad?” she asked mr. murdoch in her fractured english, according to a person close to news corporation who attended the meeting. unsatisfied with his answer, she approached him after the meeting, and they discussed media and china and business, all things that, coming from a younger, attractive woman, apparently proved an aphrodisiac to mr. murdoch. \n",
            " he had been taken aback at how direct ms. deng was (friends say she still has almost no brain-to-mouth filter) and how much she enjoyed talking business, according to people close to the couple. \n",

            " in the early days of marriage, much was made of mr. murdoch’s transformation: his shoddy hair-dye job, prada suits, workout regimen and new soho loft. but less noted was the transformation happening to his wife. mrs. murdoch’s friends like to talk about how the money has not fundamentally changed the brash, unfiltered, funny woman mr. murdoch first met in kowloon. but in other ways, mr. murdoch’s billions have significantly transformed her. \n",
            " she used to wash her clothes and face with the same soap, said a 2008 vogue article, and seldom wore makeup, much less luxuriated in the perks of privilege — like the private yoga classes with her friends kathy freston and arianna huffington — she indulges in today. at yale, she would stake out filene’s basement to procure designer gowns on the cheap. today, she is regularly photographed wearing rodarte and prada. \n",
            " mrs. murdoch quickly and giddily embraced the trappings of great wealth. while her husband conducted business in various european capitals, she would travel with him and shop for glassware and cutlery and curtains to stock her new homes. in addition to their loft in soho, the murdochs transformed an old hutong in beijing into a courtyard oasis decorated with art by chinese artists. \n",
            " at the same time, she tried to find a place for herself in the family business, brokering meetings in china and weighing in on myspace’s chinese operations. as head of star tv, james murdoch worked with his stepmother to try to repair news corporation’s standing in china. in turn, mrs. murdoch earned james’s respect, and he became the first of mr. murdoch’s four grown children to accept his father’s third marriage, according to a person close to the murdoch family. \n",
            " still, there were bumps. the first came in 2000, when the wall street journal, not yet owned by news corporation, published a 4,000-word front-page article about her. it described how, in 1988 at age 19, she had moved to los angeles with a married couple, jake and joyce cherry, to learn english. mr. cherry and wendi deng had an affair, according to the article, and she married him in 1990. the marriage lasted two years seven months, according to los angeles court records. in that time, she got a green card and enrolled at california state university, northridge. \n",
            " mr. murdoch was furious, according to people close to news corporation who would not discuss the article on the record, even though it was the kind of article he would have loved — had it been in one of his newspapers and about someone else’s third wife. \n",
            " the article and subsequent follow-ups by other publications branded mrs. murdoch as a calculating seductress for much of the next decade. \n",
            " then in 2006, there was an infamous marital battle when mr. murdoch declared in a tv interview with charlie rose that while grace and chloe, his daughters with wendi, would have an equal economic interest in the family’s trust, they would not have the same voting rights as his children from his previous marriages, prudence, elisabeth, lachlan and james. \n",
            " wendi murdoch was enraged. it was the first she had heard of that decision. \n",
            " “he became this typical husband whose wife threatened to leave him,” said a person close to news corporation who would not speak for attribution about the murdochs’ relationship. “it was surreal.” \n",
            " they worked through it, and by all accounts, wendi has had a hugely positive impact on rupert. she will openly roll her eyes at him when he’s out of line and tell him when he’s wrong, even while the two are in public. \n",
            " “she has a great upbeat personality and is one of the few people who can keep rupert murdoch under control,” said mr. butcher, the former news corporation spokesman. “in the very early days of the marriage she was somewhat subordinate, but that pretty quickly changed.” \n",
            " as their daughters, grace, 10, and chloe, 8 (whom mrs. murdoch refers to as “grace chloe” in her still-heavily accented english) get older, she has taken on a wide range of professional endeavors, including the film business. mrs. murdoch was actively involved in the production of “snow flower and the secret fan,” and according to all accounts she thoroughly enjoyed her autonomy and power. at one point she stood up in a boardroom full of china’s most powerful film executives and demanded that the posters for “snow flower” be better positioned around shanghai and that more money be spent on marketing. \n",
            " “they all just got quiet and took it in,” said wayne wang, the film’s director. “the next day i started to see posters on the streets and buses that were the way she wanted them.” \n",
            " even as she forges her own identity, mr. murdoch’s influence is never far. “snow flower” was released domestically by news corporation’s fox searchlight in july 2011 just as revelations surfaced that the news of the world had hacked into the voice mail of milly dowler, the teenager who had been kidnapped and murdered. the film grossed only about $11 million worldwide. \n",
            " in recent months, as james murdoch continues to face scrutiny about his involvement in the scandal in britain, and has resigned several key positions in the murdoch empire, investors have questioned the future leadership of news corporation. in only the most hushed and off-the-record conversations do people close to the company ask: could wendi take over one day? \n",
            " doubtful. in contrast to anna murdoch, who had an office on news corporation’s corporate floor and a position on the board until 1998, when mr. murdoch forced her off, the third mrs. murdoch is kept at a distance. \n",

            " mrs. murdoch was an early investor in art.sy, an online start-up designed to help art enthusiasts browse works from galleries, museums and private collections. early on, the web site was having difficulty convincing gallery owners and artists to agree to allow it to display their art online. \n",
            " mrs. murdoch brought on her friend dasha zhukova, the russian socialite and wife of the billionaire roman abramovich. the two women hosted parties in miami’s art basel to help introduce the art.sy founder, carter cleveland, to larry gagosian and marc glimcher, among other key players gathered for the annual art fair. \n",
            " “here i was a 24-year-old nerdy computer science major, and i was going from booth to booth with dasha and wendi,” mr. cleveland said. \n",
            " mrs. murdoch initially found out about art.sy the way wealthy and well-connected people hear about potential investments: through a friend. the friend was joshua kushner, who runs the private equity firm thrive capital and whose sister-in-law, ivanka trump, is a close friend of mrs. murdoch’s. \n",
            " the murdochs briefly occupied a nearby condo in the trump park avenue building, where jared kushner and ivanka trump live. grace and chloe speak mandarin to ms. trump’s young daughter, arabella, and the murdoch women regularly attend ms. trump’s sabbath dinners. (“she loves the challah,” ms. trump said of mrs. murdoch. “she calls it ‘that bread.’ ”) \n",
            " in recent months, the murdochs have grown to live largely separate lives, with mrs. murdoch taking the girls to piano lessons and attending red-carpet galas, and mr. murdoch dealing with the scandal unfolding in britain. as mrs. murdoch attended the oscars in february, mr. murdoch traveled to london to visit the newsroom of the embattled sun tabloid, which has been accused of widespread bribery to a network of corrupt officials. \n",
            " he rarely accompanies her to the many charitable events and parties she attends, partly because he is 81 and partly to avoid the news media, said several people close to the couple who did not want to discuss their marital relations for attribution. (this weekend, the couple are vacationing in venice, after attending news corporation meetings in rome and milan.) \n",
            " it has not been entirely easy for mrs. murdoch to feel comfortable around the kind of company she now keeps. “i’ve seen her evolve over time in terms of her capacity to handle meeting people in the industry and senior government officials,” said ms. shan, her graduate school roommate. “initially that wasn’t her comfort zone.” \n",
            " mrs. murdoch still regularly (and humorously) drops references to how far she has come since her meager childhood in china. \n",

            "bangkok — in one of her first speeches outside her country in 24 years, daw aung san suu kyi, the leader of myanmar’s democracy movement, stared down an audience of corporate executives here on friday and urged them to avoid “reckless optimism” and to be aware of the pitfalls her country still holds for investors. \n",
            " fearing a flood of investment that might harm myanmar by increasing corruption and inequality, ms. aung san suu kyi laid out in unsparing terms the problems facing her country, including an educational system that is in a shambles and youth unemployment that is a “time bomb.” \n",
            " she also noted that myanmar, which has been moving swiftly away from dictatorship in the last year, is not a “genuinely democratic society” and, in a swipe at the government that only recently freed her from house detention, suggested that some business deals were already moving forward without transparency. \n",
            " that, she suggested, is bad both for the country and for business. \n",
            " “would-be investors in burma, please be warned,” she said, referring to the country by its former name. “even the best investment laws would be of no use whatsoever if there are no courts that are clean enough and independent enough to be able to administer those laws justly. this is our problem: so far we have not been aware of any reforms on the judicial front.” \n",
            " the remarks came two weeks after the united states, following countries in europe and elsewhere, opened the door to the first significant american investments in myanmar in decades — a move ms. aung san suu kyi endorsed, but only if some sanctions remained in place because political changes were not yet “irreversible.” the obama administration did leave a raft of sanctions on the books in what secretary of state hillary rodham clinton has called “an insurance policy” against a stall in reforms by the government, according to a statement at the time. \n",
            " as a dissident who was detained at her home for 15 years by myanmar’s ruling generals, ms. aung san suu kyi was known for her defiance of the military, stubbornness and strong will. now a member of parliament, elected under a new civilian government’s fledgling political reforms, she did not modulate from that tone at the conference on friday despite the high profile of the gathering. the meeting was put on by the world economic forum, the group that also hosts the annual gathering in davos, switzerland. \n",
            " “i would not like you to be over-optimistic,” she said. “these days, i’m coming across a lot of what i would call reckless optimism.” \n",
            " some in the audience thought that ms. aung san suu kyi had gone too far with her call for caution. \n",
            " “i thought she was excessively pessimistic,” said joseph e. stiglitz, a professor of economics at columbia university who has helped advise the myanmar government during its transition from military dictatorship. \n",
            " mr. stiglitz said that despite “uncertainties” and a weak judicial system, foreign investors could expect good returns. he compared myanmar to china. the rule of law is very weak in china, yet the country has grown at an impressive pace for the last three decades, and foreign investors have profited, he said. \n",
            " in myanmar, he said, the government’s commitment to investment “implies it will be sensitive to the concerns of investors.” \n",
            " ms. aung san suu kyi said she did not want to discourage investment, speaking instead of what she described as healthy skepticism. “i think you should see it as a word of caution, a strong word of caution,” she told reporters. \n",
            " her message contrasted with a presentation by u than htay, myanmar’s minister of energy, that received much less prominent billing. “the new government is encouraging foreign investors to invest in wide-ranging industries,” mr. than htay said. \n",
            " he spoke in place of myanmar’s president, thein sein, who was to have attended but canceled soon after news reports appeared saying that ms. aung san suu kyi would go and after organizers released a schedule giving her prominent billing. members of his staff said he could not make the time to go. his visit to thailand had been rescheduled for next week, but that was also canceled, the thai foreign ministry said friday. \n",
            " mr. than htay’s speech was a classic pitch to potential investors. he said the government was “making important strides” in education policies, and spoke about the country’s tourism potential. he also promoted several special economic zones that the government had approved for foreign investors. \n",
            " it was those zones that drew ms. aung san suu kyi’s criticism for a lack of transparency. referring to an economic zone near the border with thailand, she said, “we, the people of burma, were kept completely in the dark about what was in the contracts, about what was going on. \n",

            " as a result, a number of risk analysts — not just those at the forum — are looking less at the specific nature of individual disasters and more at potential connections between them. these have become increasingly evident in a variety of shocks in the last decade or so, including the terrorist attacks of sept. 11, the global financial crisis that began in 2007 and the eruption of a volcano in iceland in 2010, which produced a huge ash cloud that disrupted air travel across europe for about a week. \n",
            " “it seems like we are facing a lot more disasters,” said bernice lee, research director for energy, environment and resource governance at the british research organization chatham house. “but it may just be that we are feeling their impacts more because they are more globalized.” \n",
            " in a separate report for chatham house, ms. lee argues that the world has grown more vulnerable to such events in recent years because of various factors, including the rise of the internet and the popularity of the so-called just-in-time model of supply-chain management in business. \n",
            " under this system, many companies stock only enough parts to keep assembly lines running for a few days. in normal times, this cuts costs and makes manufacturers more flexible. when disaster strikes, however, businesses may be more vulnerable than in the days when warehouses stocked months of supplies. \n",
            " the internet, meanwhile, can magnify and spread the effects of a disaster in other ways. rumors, even if incorrect, spread quickly on social networking sites — sometimes more rapidly than emergency services can communicate accurate information. as word of disasters like the terror attacks of sept. 11 or the earthquake in japan spreads globally, consumers hunker down in front of their computer screens or televisions, rather than going about their daily lives. this increases the economic effects of a crisis, even in areas far removed from the source. \n",
            " howard kunreuther, professor of decision sciences and business and public policy at wharton, said that after the earthquake in japan, researchers noticed an increase in sales of earthquake insurance, even in places at little or no risk of earthquakes. \n",
            " “before an event, nobody thinks something will happen to them,” he said. “after an event, people sometimes act equally irrationally.” \n",
            " while scientists can predict the probability — if not the exact timing or scale — of certain natural disasters, the ability to read a crystal ball may be more helpful than complex calculations in determining risks stemming from human events. \n",

            "how could the world guarantee a steady supply of rare earths, the 17 elements crucial for many of the electronics used in everyday life, at a time when china controlled more than 90 per cent of global production?\n",
            "as executive chairman of lynas, an australia-listed miner that owns what it says is the “richest known deposit” of rare earths in the world, mr curtis was well placed to answer their queries.\n",
            "he said the world sorely needs new suppliers of rare earths, including lynas and us-listed molycorp, but also pointed out that china also welcomed the arrival of alternative suppliers. the davos meeting came only months after fears intensified that china’s dominance of rare earths could be used to hold the world hostage to supply after it unexpectedly slashed export quotas and briefly suspended shipments to japan following a diplomatic dispute.\n",
            "but in an interview with the financial times, mr curtis sees others forces at work. “the reality is that china needs to use its rare earths themselves,” he says. “rare earths have become a token for international fears over china’s ascendancy. but there is not a machiavellian plot by china to take over the world in rare earths.”\n",
            "in fact, mr curtis expects that china’s demand for rare earths will exceed 110,000 tonnes by 2015 “and at that point they could become net importers”, a critical turning point in the global industry.\n",
            "mr curtis is nothing if not ambitious for lynas, a company he has led for more than a decade. lynas is still in late-stage development but mr curtis is optimistic the australian group will begin first its shipments of rare earths next year. he says the miner is already producing rare earths concentrate at mount weld in western australia but admits the group’s refinery on the east coast of malaysia “is running a bit late”.\n",
            "crucial to lynas entering production is for kuala lumpur to issue the australian group with an operating licence. that process has been bogged down by political opposition to the plant and local community protests worried about possible radiation leaks. lynas on wednesday said a decision had not been reached on the application. shares in the company fell 9.9 per cent to a$1.09 in sydney. \n",
            "but mr curtis says the international atomic energy agency this year conducted an independent review into the plant. “they came out and said it was a safe process and made some recommendations that lynas has agreed to comply with,” he says.\n",
            "mike harrowell, rare earths analyst at bby, an australian financial services group, expects the operating licence to be granted in november, but says there is a risk it would get caught up in malaysia’s next general election, expected to be held in 2012.\n",
            "“if it was a regulatory decision, lynas should be able to jump through any hoops. but if it is a political decision, then the risk of a more negative outcome increase,” mr harrowell says.\n",
            "assuming approval is granted in the coming months, lynas could ship first product in the second quarter of next year. \n",
            "“lynas is poised to deliver,” mr harrowell says. “over the last decade, [mr] curtis has positioned the company to be delivering product in the first wave of a new generation of western suppliers.”\n",
            "but lynas’s production launch also comes at an uncertain time for the rare earths industry. rare earth prices reached unsustainable levels this year due to production bottlenecks but they have fallen heavily since april. analysts expect further price weakness.\n",
            "“prices have come off a lot,” mr curtis says. “three years ago, [a basket of] rare earths were less than $10 [per] kilogramme, then they shot up to more than $200 and now they are back to less than $150.”\n",
            "even mr curtis expects further falls. “prices still have a little bit to come back but even $80 to $125 remains a very sustainable level to industry,” he says.\n",

            "azerbaijan receives its distinguished guests in the president’s office, a soviet-era edifice that disfigures the otherwise picturesque centre of the capital, baku.\n",
            "this 13-storey monolith was once the communist party headquarters. more recently it has hosted the duke of york in his role as ambassador for british trade. as a symbol of both royalty and capitalism, prince andrew might stand as a living rebuke to the old order in this former soviet republic.\n",
            "but his dealings with azerbaijan have also attracted much criticism at home. prince andrew has held regular meetings with ilham aliyev, president of azerbaijan, most recently at the world economic forum at davos in january.\n",
            "mr aliyev cannot boast many democratic credentials. he inherited the presidency from his father in 2003, placing azerbaijan in the same unflattering category as syria and north korea as a “republic” with a hereditary leader.\n",
            "he is not a totalitarian figure: he allows opposition parties, a small independent press and a good measure of freedom of expression. azerbaijan signed the european convention on human rights and joined the council of europe.\n",
            "but parliament is a rubber stamp and elections are merely rituals. the last parliamentary poll, held in november 2010, saw the president’s allies win 112 out of 125 seats.\n",
            "“this is a very typical middle eastern dictatorship – which is a member of the council of europe,” said ilgar mammadov, co-chairman of the republicanist alternative movement, an opposition pressure group. “the november parliamentary election was very depressing for us: it was a festival of authoritarianism.”\n",
            "britain has quietly become the dominant outside player in azerbaijan’s economy. last year, the uk invested almost £1bn in the country or 51.9 per cent of total foreign investment in azerbaijan.\n",
            "no other nation reached double figures: next biggest was the us at 9 per cent. turkey, a neighbour sharing ties of language and kinship, managed only 3.9 per cent. china did not feature in the league.\n",
            "bp, the oil company, accounted for the vast majority of british investment. bp has run azerbaijan’s largest oilfield since 1996 and now develops new gas reserves.\n",
            "bp’s involvement predates prince andrew’s appointment as the uk’s trade envoy in 2000. the duke has been deployed to widen british business interests beyond energy.\n",
            "he spoke in baku in 2009 on behalf of landis+gyr, a uk company supplying 300,000 advanced electricity meters. oil revenues have also caused a building boom in the capital, opening up opportunities for construction companies.\n",
            "prince andrew’s visits are not big stories for azerbaijan’s official media. during his most recent trip in november, state news blandly reported mr aliyev had “received” the duke and “praised relations between azerbaijan and the uk, in particular economic co-operation”.\n",
            "critics say mr aliyev uses his association with british royalty to burnish his reputation. prince andrew has helped him to build an “image as someone . . . received at the very highest level of the european aristocracy”, said mr mammadov. “we never felt that prince andrew’s contribution has helped the democratic process.”\n",
            "some independent observers believe closer ties with the west will help democratic reform.\n",
            "“i am optimistic: i predict we will see big changes in the next three years,” said mehman aliyev, director of turan, an independent news agency. “the demands come from the us and the western world.”\n",
            "if the president proves to be a reformer – and his first eight years have not been encouraging – then prince andrew’s visits may be seen to have helped.\n",
            "meanwhile, the old bargain prevails: britain wins the biggest stake in azerbaijan’s economy and mr aliyev is pictured alongside the fourth in line to the throne.\n",

            "the unfinished global revolution: the limits of nations and the pursuit of a new politics, by mark malloch brown, allen lane, rrp£25, 272 pages\n",
            "how to run the world: charting a course to the next renaissance, by parag khanna, random house, rrp$26, 272 pages\n",
            "how the west was lost: fifty years of economic folly – and the stark choices ahead, by dambisa moyo, allen lane, rrp£14.99, 240 pages\n",
            "the earth’s atmosphere is warming; the global economy lurches between imbalance and crisis; peacekeepers and humanitarian aid workers struggle to restrain bloody civil wars; killer diseases remain rampant; the liberal trading order is under threat. these are times that try men’s souls yet put wolfish smiles of profitable anticipation upon the lips of non-fiction publishers.\n",
            "the latest of a crop of books trying to make sense of the new global order, or absence thereof, start from a similar point: that the world’s leading governments, particularly in the rich parts of the planet, have struggled to cope with problems of growth, the environment and public health.\n",
            "their solutions vary. take your pick: better governments and wiser international co-operation; bypassing national authorities altogether; or urging everyone to be more like china. to my mind the “make the system work better” camp, articulated by the veteran policymaker mark malloch brown, is by far the most constructive. but the plaintive tone of even this perennial cheerleader for multilateralism underlines the size of the task.\n",
            "lord malloch brown’s book the unfinished global revolution is a distillation of thoughts about the need for international institutions and politics to rise to meet global challenges. his views have been gathered during a varied career in the united nations interspersed with his work for the international political consultancy sawyer miller and a rather bruising period in the steel-cage wrestling match of british politics as a cabinet minister in gordon brown’s government.\n",
            "what is attractive about malloch brown’s book is the combination of detail, authority and humility derived from decades of trying to make international co-operation work. his credibility in discussing humanitarian aid and peacekeeping is hugely enhanced by his time extemporising refugee camps on the thai border for cambodians fleeing the civil war in 1979, in the course of which, he endearingly reveals, he wrote the definitive un handbook on camp rations and emergency latrine sanitation.\n",
            "malloch brown has also worked as a journalist at the economist, and it shows. the book reveals an eye for illuminating detail, such as his description of the candlelit press conference in a manila church in 1986 by filipino vote-counters denouncing ferdinand marcos’s theft of an election, and the story of fred cuny, a 6ft 3in texan of the get-it-done school of philosophy running relief operations during the 1990s bosnian civil war.\n",
            "tiring of government bureaucracy, cuny installed a smuggled water system in sarajevo on his own initiative and flew a texan rather than a us flag over his house to underline the point.\n",
            "what emerges is a nuanced and largely realistic picture, showing that building effective institutions involves political nous as well as multilateral pieties, texas stubbornness as much as washington suavity. malloch brown’s pride at helping to create the international crisis group, the non-government conflict resolution organisation, contrasts with his frustration at the sclerotic nature of the un, a place in which, he says, “process reigned”.\n",
            "yet the book ends not with a dirge of nihilistic despair but with the plaintive aria of a frustrated global revolutionary. the burst of postwar multilateralist sentiment that created intergovernmental institutions of peacekeeping, development aid and an open trading system needs to be renewed, not reminisced about. that malloch brown does not pretend to have a definitive plan for doing so is entirely to his credit.\n",
            "more quixotic solutions are proffered by parag khanna of washington’s new america foundation think-tank, in his modestly titled how to run the world. khanna’s thesis is that we are in a new middle ages, where a collection of stable nation-states has given way to a shifting landscape of rising and falling empires and autonomous cities. multilateral official institutions are being replaced by ad hoc partnerships of individual governments, non-governmental organisations (ngos), companies and citizen activists, often assembled in corridor conversations at the world economic forum in davos.\n",
            "the analogy is striking. but quite apart from the grating thomas friedman-style neologisms (“cosmopolitan – or cause-mopolitan – ‘citizens of the world’ aspire towards a global consciousness”) both diagnosis and solution overstretch in a search for impact.\n",
            "khanna systematically overstates both the power and legitimacy of non-governmental entities. he disappointingly repeats the old leftist canard about half of the world’s largest economic entities being companies rather than countries, a highly misleading comparison between gross corporate revenues and value-added national income.\n",
            "modern industrialist families such as the indian tatas are compared with the medieval italian house of medici. yet the medicis provided rome with several popes, and their fiefdom of florence was an independent economic powerhouse that bestrode european banking and trade. tata is an impressive conglomerate, but it runs only a few steel company towns. and it is hard to imagine a modern-day indian medici being forced, as was tata, to move its flagship nano car factory from west bengal to gujurat to placate an aggrieved gaggle of dispossessed farmers.\n",
            "khanna’s argument is also far too trusting of the good faith of ngos, claiming that “their legitimacy derives from their authority of expertise, impartiality, representativeness and transparency of operations”. but as ngo trade and development activists privately admit, at least to me, their campaigns are shaped to fit an ideological template, forever blaming rich country trade tariffs and subsidies and western corporations for poverty in poor nations and ignoring huge divisions of interest within the developing world.\n",
            "running aid programmes often compromises their independence rather than bestowing it. khanna singles out ngos such as save the children as “truly independent global players”. in reality the us wing of save the children depends for nearly a third of its income on us government contracts, and fell out spectacularly with its british counterpart during the iraq invasion in 2003 when save the children uk criticised washington’s conduct of the war.\n",
            "the book consistently overstates the role of the private and voluntary sectors. it lauds the gates foundation for its ability to bypass donor governments and deal directly with poor countries and researchers in combating killer diseases. gates does excellent work, but the foundation is the first to say that its $1.8bn annual public health budget plays a relatively small supporting role, less than 5 per cent of the total spent by aid donors in that sector. nor is this a new phenomenon: it was the private rockefeller and ford foundations that funded the research underpinning the developing world’s agricultural “green revolution” in the 1960s.\n",
            "there are big gaps in global governance, but khanna is too optimistic that private foundations and corporations have the motivation, expertise and authority to fill more than a small part of them. many challenges involve externalities and co-ordination problems that cry out for government action. private research into wind turbines and solar panels is fine, but when it comes to reversing global warming, the evidence suggests that technological solutions are a complement, not a substitute, for carbon taxes to discourage emissions. this book has an eye-catching thesis, but tries too hard to compress a set of recalcitrant facts inside it.\n",
            "its exaggerations, however, pale into insignificance next to those of how the west was lost, the second book from dambisa moyo. a former goldman sachs banker, moyo became famous for her first book, dead aid, a trenchant attack on development assistance. the book’s runaway success baffled many with prior knowledge of the issues, even those broadly sympathetic to its sceptical tone, consisting as it did of a tendentious one-sided account of tired and inconclusive old academic literature about aid effectiveness.\n",
            "how the west was lost contrives to lower these standards yet further. it addresses some familiar problems in rich countries – unfunded pension liabilities, an unstable financial system, underperforming educational systems – and through gross exaggeration and straight-line extrapolation argues that the west is in “freefall” and is being swamped by the likes of china.\n",
            "the challenges it identifies are for the most part real, if not original. but the huge flaws of the emerging economies are ignored. never mind unfunded western welfare states: china has its own massive demographic problem in the form of a rapidly ageing population, worsened by the official “one-child” policy that moyo seems to think is a good thing. familiar arguments are trotted out about china focusing on manufacturing, in contrast to the west’s effete obsession with the service sector. (and this from a former goldman sachs employee.) in truth, it is hardly surprising that a much poorer (per head) economy is still dominated by industrial production, as was the us at a similar stage of economic development.\n",
            "meanwhile, some of moyo’s solutions verge on the surreal, for example that the wasteful effort of youngsters in the west trying and failing to become successful sportspeople should be deterred by imposing a supertax on those sporting stars who do make it. (intense and widespread hothousing of athletes to produce a tiny elite never happens in china, of course.)\n",
            "bizarrely, the book also flirts with the idea of the us escaping its problems through voluntarily defaulting on its government debt.\n",
            "the carelessness with fact and interpretation evident in dead aid, such as the baffling contention that fewer than 10 per cent of africans lived in extreme poverty in the early 1970s, reaches critical proportions here. a few examples: iceland did not default on its sovereign debt in 2008, and nor did the uk do so “in all but name” in 1976. fiat bought a stake in chrysler, not gm. former fed chairman alan greenspan, whatever his faults, never predicted “a world without inflation”. it is laughable to suggest that western companies dependent on intellectual property, such as pharmaceutical businesses, have not made strenuous attempts to protect their technologies: they controversially got world trade organisation law rewritten to do so. and so on, and on.\n",
            "the pattern of moyo’s books is becoming clear. they start with an extreme contention – aid is rubbish! the west is collapsing! – and assemble a variety of distortions and inventions to justify it, the quality of which suggests too much time spent with google and too little in a library. they then toss out solutions with little concern for logic – or even for internal consistency, since moyo’s severe criticisms of credit ratings agencies for encouraging the financial bubble sit at stark odds with her contention in dead aid that african governments should acquire credit ratings and borrow on the international capital markets.\n",
            "for the sake of the quality of public discourse, it would be best all round if this particular production line were to stop here.\n",
            "perhaps it is not surprising that by far the most impressive of these three attempts to make sense of governing the world is by the author who has actually tried doing it: been there, done that, written the latrine sanitation handbook. as legacies go, that is a pretty good one. neither wild pessimism about western governments nor bright-eyed optimism about the possibilities of bypassing them is a constructive response to the great global challenges of war, famine and pestilence.\n",
            "governments are an inevitable part of most solutions to global problems. they are not succeeding particularly well, and nor are the multilateral institutions that co-ordinate them. but that is an argument for driving forward the slow and halting process of trying to make them work better. these are difficult times, but they are neither a new middle ages nor the end of western civilisation.\n",

            "civilization: the west and the rest, by niall ferguson, allen lane, rrp£25, 432 pages\n",
            "niall ferguson made his name as a historian who understood the numbers, so let us start with some. the federal debt of the us is projected to be 66 per cent of gdp this year, writes andrew marr. according to one morgan stanley estimate, including medical, state and pension liabilities, the real debt-to-ratio of the us in 2009 was 358 per cent. what do these figures really mean? is the west now in fast, inevitable decline as the east rises? are we talking habsburg spain in the 1580s (65 per cent of revenues spent on debt) and ottoman turkey (50 per cent in 1877) and bourbon france (62 per cent by 1788)? are we a civilisation of sick old fellows, fat heads lolling?\n",
            "it is the purpose of ferguson’s civilization: the west and the rest to answer the question. allied to the cassandra-conservatism school, which includes correlli barnett and (less successfully) samuel huntingdon, he accumulates an arsenal of compelling information about the swing up and the vertigo-inducing look down. here is the academy arriving to stiffen the sinews and summon the blood of a civilisation which has lost its way.\n",
            "ferguson is too sensible to be hyper-literal. historical comparisons are always “up to a point, lord copper”. financial stability depends on perception; the most that can be said about us debt is that it opens the world’s leading power to a further crisis if sentiment flips, leading to “a kind of death spiral of falling confidence, rising yields and rising deficits”. we are teetering. i suppose we know that.\n",
            "“west versus china” history has become a busy highway. ian morris had a wonderful book on long-term civilisational history out last year, why the west rules – for now. stanford university has a superb project comparing ancient rome and han china. the stories of china’s tragic inner turn after her fleets had reached africa (in the early 15th century) are now understood by schoolchildren. numerous analysts, from left and right, including david landes, martin jacques and will hutton have studied more recent history.\n",
            "because ferguson is considered “a bit too much” – too successful, too rich, too good-looking, too many top roosts – and because this book accompanies a television series (smelling salts, professor!) he may not be welcomed aboard the bandwagon.\n",
            "he ought to be. this is sharp. it feels urgent. ferguson, with a properly financially literate mind, twists his knife with great literary brio. seeking the causes for western supremacy he focuses on competition, science, property laws, medical advances, mass consumption and the work ethic. he brings in some unexpected actors, from simon bolivar to an english gunnery pioneer. he rummages through medical records and comparative wage rates, measured by silver.\n",
            "parts of the argument remain unresolved, and he admits it. max weber’s equals sign between “the protestant ethic” and “the spirit of capitalism” has been fairly comprehensively scrubbed out by later historians. there were higher growth rates in protestant countries after the reformation but this may be because southern europe was under the thumb of dynasties that were anti-industrialist as well as catholic. and what are we then to make of such throbbing hives of capitalist success as catholic northern italy, or indeed catholic southern germany? as to the work ethic, post-communist and confucian chinese seem able to teach the bairns of knox and luther a thing or two.\n",
            "cross-currents repeatedly disturb the story of a simple flow to success on the back of adam smith’s principles: protectionist tariffs helped the british cotton manufacturers and the infant industries of the us; today’s protestant churches are more get-rich-quick than defer-it. or take japan: her first great leap into modernity was enforced by the imperial state, stealing from the west with reckless enthusiasm; and had little to do with common law or competition.\n",
            "so this is a complicated story. some of the best passages concern the history of consumerism, which has been less studied by mainstream historians than, say, inflation, trade policy or capital accumulation. there are excellent points about the nazis’ failure to create a consumer society and about the modern paradox that standardisation (jeans, coke) went alongside rampant individualism. his research throws up enjoyably unfamiliar quotes, such as khrushchev’s warning that it was just a small step “from saxophones to switchblades” and a soviet critic’s hilarious warning that “every ounce of energy used on the dance floor” was energy which “could and should have been invested in building a hydroelectric plant”.\n",
            "as we would expect, ferguson is robust in defence of imperialism, homing in particularly on the impact of western science on death-rates inside european empires. and we have spent long enough, perhaps, flagellating ourselves for our familiar crimes: how many of us knew that the taiping rebellion against the qing killed 20m people in the middle of the 19th century?\n",
            "ferguson shows that no ideological or material reductionism quite works for the rise of the west, and therefore as an explanation for its possible fall; not geography, trade winds, inheritance law, or even the experimental continent america gave europe. as to the future, he is not a defeatist; western civilisation’s pluralism, freedom of thought, property rights and democracy remain huge strengths.\n",
            "this reviewer’s main niggle is that we could have done with more politics. looking back in a century’s time at the west today, and particularly at europe, won’t historians express amazement at the poor quality of our decision-making elite – the lack of training, information, support, follow-through, hard analysis and proper policy debate? too many clever people in financial services, too few serving the state? too little long-termism, too few unpalatable shifts in direction confronted? and might they not decide that here china, for all her repressive and centralised structure, took a lead, at least for a while, as she stretched out for new agricultural and mineral land? \n",
            "ferguson ends by suggesting the biggest threat is not china but ourselves – our cowardice, drawn from ignorance, even stupidity, about our past. he is right. but as he shows himself, that can be fixed.\n",
            "andrew marr is a bbc presenter and author of ‘the making of modern britain’ (pan macmillan). niall ferguson’s ‘civilization: is the west history?’ begins on march 6 on channel 4\n",

            "has the man who owns the news lost control of it? rupert murdoch, the press baron behind titles ranging from the australian to the times and the wall street journal, is suddenly making the headlines rather than writing them. \n",
            "with assets worth $56bn that stretch from star tv in india to fox news in the us, his news corp is the first truly global media group. no stranger to controversy, it now finds itself the subject of legal, media and political scrutiny of an intensity seldom seen before.\n",
            "that follows fresh allegations that journalists on the news of the world, its racy uk sunday tabloid, intercepted voicemail messages of scores of public figures. buckingham palace called in the police, hollywood celebrities ran to their lawyers, britain’s prime minister sacrificed his communications chief and scotland yard faced accusations of fumbling its initial inquiry.\n",
            "for 18 months after clive goodman, the news of the world’s royal editor, was jailed in january 2007, the “phone hacking” issue seemed to vanish. the revelations had seemed to confirm long-held suspicions about a widespread culture in the uk newspaper industry. ruthless competition coupled with chequebook journalism had fuelled an “anything goes” atmosphere in some titles.\n",
            "for the police unit that investigated, it was convenient for this to be a limited event. ni, believing that it could contain the damage, maintained a “rogue reporter” defence. then, in july 2009, the guardian asserted that the practice had been much more widespread than the police investigation or ni’s statements had uncovered. it also revealed that the publisher had quietly settled three outstanding civil suits for breach of privacy, paying at least £1.7m. the house of commons select committee on media reopened its inquiry, but scotland yard quickly said there was nothing more to investigate.\n",
            "it was when the new york times published the results of a seven-month investigation last september, in effect alleging a police cover-up and accusing ni of concealing the extent of phone hacking, that “suddenly, a lot of people started to worry about it again”, a senior executive at a rival tabloid group says. \n",
            "a new police investigation now looms after ni this week turned a strong investigative light on itself and began – finally – to clean its house. its decision to fire a former news of the world head of news and hand its findings to the metropolitan police came as the new york-based mr murdoch headed for london on a trip that was supposed to be a stopover en route to davos. instead, the 79-year-old chief executive shunned the world economic forum to huddle with top uk lieutenants, taking meals not in a swiss chalet but in ni’s sixth-floor canteen, which is said to resemble an ikea showroom.\n",
            "london was where the australian-born mr murdoch established himself on the world stage, buying the news of the world in 1969. kelvin mckenzie, a former editor of the sun, that paper’s daily sister, says of mr murdoch’s actions this week: “rupert has not stayed in business for 60 years by turning a blind eye to things like this and he has acted as the ceo of a public company should.”\n",
            "even so, tabloid tactics pose unpredictable financial and personnel risks to his empire, while bringing the perennial topic of succession back to the fore. moreover, although the scandal’s origins date back five years, “the timing of it could not be worse”, one former executive says. last june, news corp revealed a £7.8bn ($12.4bn) plan to buy the 61 per cent that it does not already own in british sky broadcasting, the country’s main satellite television service. the still unresolved deal would be mr murdoch’s largest ever acquisition, reshaping his company and, critics argue, changing the face of media in britain. \n",
            "yet the unfolding events around the news of the world have clouded its prospects. after intense lobbying from rivals including the bbc, a “media plurality” review could now stall the deal for six to eight months.\n",
            "any delay matters because with each passing month, the target becomes more costly. sky’s free cash flow, the core of its appeal to news corp, is soaring after a wave of investment subsided. but as sky’s finances have strengthened, so too has its stock. the shares, trading at barely 600p before news corp revealed its 700p approach, have risen to 762.5p.\n",
            "“he is very unhappy about all this. he fears that this will scupper his chances of getting full control of sky. i know that for sure,” says andrew neil, former editor of the sunday times and a close associate of mr murdoch for many years. “he thinks the whole news of the world thing has been handled appallingly and he has moved in to do it himself, cancelled davos and all that, but he fears that what they are doing now, being seen to clear out the stable, is too little too late. but he is a fighter and he is still trying to do it.\n",
            "“you wouldn’t believe what a cultural change this [openness] is for news. normally when they are up against it, they survive on a code of omerta. the problem for rupert is that he has to be seen to be doing something, but he just doesn’t know where what he has set in motion will lead or whose job it might cost.”\n",
            "mr murdoch, who nearly lost control of his company as start-up losses spiralled at sky 20 years ago, has come back from worse. but as he moved to get the bid back on track, some around news corp, especially senior figures outside the uk, ask how the scandal happened, why it was not contained and what its handling says about today’s news corp.\n",
            "news corp is a disciplined place, where executives are paid handsomely and expected to remain loyal. in interviews with a dozen insiders, former executives, advisers and others close to the company – most of whom regard themselves as friends of the company – none was prepared to speak on the record. yet clear if competing narratives emerge, highlighting rival factions around the company’s different family members, cities and generations.\n",
            "there is disbelief in some quarters that a five-year-old london story has been allowed to drag the group’s reputation through the mire. “i have never in my life felt more like i am in a john grisham novel. a series of very, very significant errors of judgment have been made over something relatively unthreatening,” says one person close to the group.\n",
            "inside ni, fingers point at external forces. the company sees an opposition labour party eager to keep in the headlines a story that led to last week’s resignation of andy coulson, a former news of the world editor, as director of communications for david cameron, prime minister. it thinks fee-chasing lawyers are trying to squeeze settlements from the empire. and it believes those rivals that have chased the story have had commercial motives. it includes the financial times in this group.\n",
            "some other fingers point at james murdoch, the mogul’s second son, who was running sky when the alleged phone hacking took place, but took oversight of ni three years ago when he was made chief executive of news corp europe and asia. while he signed off on large payments to settle out of court on cases that could have undermined attempts to contain the scandal, a friend points out that this came just weeks into his tenure and was done on the advice of others.\n",
            "still, he came into the role “guns blazing”, one former colleague says, marking himself out with withering criticism of regulators, a blistering speech about the bbc’s “state-sponsored journalism” and one incident where he stormed into the newsroom of the rival independent newspaper and delivered a tirade against its editor laden with four-letter words.\n",
            "james murdoch’s sharp elbows made him few friends, three people say, and several insiders believe that those he lashed out against are now getting their revenge. his father generally gets his way in a quieter fashion. “if rupert were [based] in london, this would have been killed somehow. it would not have reached this crescendo,” one long-term colleague argues.\n",
            "some on both sides of the atlantic suggest that the uk newspaper operation suffered from the departure of an older generation of experienced executives such as les hinton, who handed the reins of ni to rebekah brooks, a former editor of the sun, when he went to run dow jones in 2007. \n",
            "governance questions have spilled into speculation over who will lead the company after murdoch snr. james emerged as heir presumptive only after his older brother lachlan stepped down from executive duties in 2005. the sky deal could be james’s crowning achievement, giving him command of a big engine of growth. but elisabeth, mr murdoch’s second daughter, is playing a more visible role, and is in talks that could lead to tighter ties between news corp and her shine production company.\n",
            "james’s current status as first among his sibling equals means he also has most to lose should events in the uk take any further unexpected turn. he has yet to win around some company critics who disagreed with his aggressive but costly investments in itv of the uk and sky deutschland. but one ally says: “james’s view is that this is the time for the family and colleagues to be fighting for the company and fighting for the family.” \n",
            "the more pressing question of when, and with what conditions, the sky deal will get done comes at a time when news corp is in need of new profit drivers. its last big deal, the $5.7bn acquisition of dow jones in 2007, was followed by a $2.8bn writedown. in the wider company, investors wonder how news corp plans to stem losses from myspace, the once-hot social networking site that has lost ground, and millions of dollars, as facebook has soared. chase carey, news corp’s chief operating officer, has warned it may be sold.\n",
            "shareholders’ “constant fear” of unexpected acquisitions such as myspace and dow jones has left news corp trading at a discount to its peers, one investor notes. nomura analysts calculate that, putting news corp’s booming cable networks to one side, investors value its other assets at just two times annual earnings. news corp could improve its rating by spinning off its newspapers, this investor says. bankers have occasionally pitched that idea but no executive has ever dared champion it. “it would be like telling rupert he’d have to spin off one of his children,” a former executive says.\n",
            "investors still see the sky deal as the best use of news corp’s cash. if it wins, the deal will shift news corp’s axis further from print to pay-tv platforms and content, and a more even mix between us and other assets.\n",
            "even as fox news faces criticism for some of its commentators’ rhetoric, the cable division it leads is bringing in more than half news corp’s operating income. once the group can include bskyb’s results in full, cable and satellite will account for two-thirds of the total. as roger ailes has proven as head of fox news, profits translate into power at news corp. so for james murdoch, that larger contribution to the bottom line could be critical to his future standing. \n",
            "only one man knows the succession plan, though, and close associates say he is “in very good shape”. mr murdoch will turn 80 this year – but his mother will turn 102 next month. “rupert’s not going anywhere” is a common company refrain.\n",
            "as a result, insiders tend to take the long view. recalling the uproar that greeted mr murdoch’s battles with print unions a generation ago at wapping, ni’s east london base, one supporter says: “we’ll get through this.”\n",
            "when mr murdoch showed up unexpectedly at the morning news conference at the times on wednesday, editors took it as a sign that he was reasserting his personal control. mr murdoch was “like a bull in a china shop” in addressing the crisis, mr neil says, adding: “wapping is not a place you want to be just now.”\n",

            "the 23rd annual tulane corporate law institute, an annual gathering of deal makers in new orleans, begins on thursday. it’s not the glittering affair of the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, but rather a wonky convention of investment bankers, lawyers and others in the takeover business. \n",
            " a number of roiling issues are at the top of the deal-making agenda. these are some of the likely topics. \n",
            " state of the market: the market for mergers and acquisitions has been surging, with domestic activity increasing to $912 billion in 2010, from a low of $799 billion in 2009, according to dealogic. with the announcement of at&t’s $39 billion bid for t-mobile usa, this year is off to a good start. \n",
            " but all is not well. strategic bidders remain focused on their businesses, hesitant to engage in risky takeover transactions. the credit market is bubbly, but private equity is still having trouble committing capital. \n",
            " this is despite having about $540 billion in dry powder to spend, according to preqin, an independent research firm. the combination of hesitant strategic bidders and private equity’s commitment problems are constraining the growth of the m.&a. market. \n",
            " international opportunities are looking less promising, with china in an inflationary period, japan experiencing a terrible natural disaster, europe struggling with sovereign debt and the middle east in turmoil. because of this, the prospects for deals in the united states look better than in many other countries for the first time in years despite the american economy’s problems. \n",
            " national security regulation: countries are racing to tighten the criteria governing foreign takeovers of domestic companies. in the last year, canada refused to approve bhp billiton’s acquisition of the potash corporation of saskatchewan, while the united states forced huawei, a chinese telecommunications company, to unwind a small $2 million technology purchase. china has retaliated by adopting its own national security process for foreign investment to go along with its ordinary approval requirements for foreign buyers. \n",
            " expect the discussions at tulane to focus on the kinds of backroom negotiations that are taking place over the national security approval process, particularly when the buyer is chinese. this is a concern because the united states appears increasingly intolerant of that country’s investments. \n",
            " investment bankers: investment bankers are feeling under siege by the delaware courts. the most prominent example was in the recent del monte case. barclays, which was representing del monte but was also providing financing to the buyers in what is called staple financing, was accused of having secret contacts with prospective bidders in breach of agreements del monte had negotiated. a delaware court criticized this conduct, though some have called barclays a hero for obtaining a high-premium offer. the del monte opinion comes on the heels of recent delaware cases finding that investment bankers had inadequately disclosed information about their financial advice. \n",
            " it all means that bankers are worried that they will make another misstep and come under heavy public criticism. at least one law firm has called into question the continued use of staple financing after del monte. \n",
            " investment bankers are bound to now rely more heavily on lawyers during the acquisition process. but the del monte case may be an outlier where a bank simply did a bad thing. the discussion at tulane will be about the procedures del monte necessitates, but the real debate should be whether all of the additional requirements for investment bank financial advice are really worthwhile or just more process and disclosure without a purpose. \n",
            " ‘lock-up creep’: increasingly in friendly deals, there is what i call lock-up creep. lock-ups are devices intended to protect a deal from third-party bidders. the best-known type of lock-ups are termination fees payable if the deal is trumped by a third-party bidder. but the trend in recent deals is for enhanced lock-ups, hence, lock-up creep. for example, initial bidders are receiving expansive information rights that entitle them to know about every conversation with a third-party bidder. the issue is whether boards are using this silence to go too far in giving their chosen bidder a sure deal with lock-ups. \n",
            " management buyouts: the j. crew buyout arranged by the private equity firms tpg capital and leonard green showed the problems of management participation unduly affecting the sale process. the talk of tulane will be about how to prevent management from using its upper hand to buy out the company unfairly. and the focus will again be on more process. \n",
            " but the real solution may simply be for boards to be more vigilant. for example, rae systems recently agreed to a buyout by battery ventures. when another bidder emerged and the chief executive and significant stockholder refused to endorse a new, higher offer from battery ventures, the board took a novel position. it proposed to issue new shares to dilute the manager’s stake and sell the company to battery ventures anyway. this is an aggressive response, but it shows that boards can effectively manage the sale process. following good procedures is merely a sign of this vigilance, a trait shareholders should encourage. \n",
            " takeover defenses: the proper balance of takeover defenses will be a topic at tulane. the delaware chancery court recently allowed airgas the use of a poison pill to defeat a hostile bid by air products. the airgas decision shows how a poison pill can work effectively with a staggered board, a board in which directors are elected in one-third tranches. bidders must thus wait two years to elect a majority of the board and force the poison pill to be redeemed. in airgas’s wake, a pill and staggered board have become a more powerful antitakeover device. \n",
            " but the decision is spurring shareholder activists to seek work-arounds. lucian a. bebchuk, a harvard law professor and a leading advocate for shareholders, has written that shareholders need to increase their lobbying efforts to force corporations to drop staggered boards because of airgas. \n",
            " companies are fighting back. oklahoma recently adopted a statute requiring all of its companies to have staggered boards on the heels of a similar law in indiana. the question now is how hard companies will fight to adopt or keep these types of boards and whether they will begin to lobby more widely for laws that support them. \n",
            " shareholder activism: shareholder activism is a perennial discussion at tulane. hedge fund activism is likely to surpass precrisis levels in coming years. companies are increasingly fighting back, and the battle is shifting to the securities and exchange commission over an amendment to the share ownership reporting requirements. the discussion will not focus on meta issues like efforts to work with hedge funds to build better governance, a trend we are seeing in a few particularly troubled companies like st. joe and dynegy. rather and unfortunately, it will focus on the more mundane issues of the tactics to beat activists. \n",

            " on a night in late january when he should have been in the swiss village of davos, james murdoch went to dinner here with his father, rupert, and several journalists from the sun, the tabloid that the murdochs have owned since 1969. \n",
            " in the private room at wheeler’s of st. james’s, father and son politely argued about the lesser of the public controversies swirling around the murdoch empire: the firing of andy gray, the chief soccer pundit for their sky sports network, for making sexist comments. \n",
            " “can we stop firing people for making a joke?” rupert murdoch asked. \n",
            " james murdoch defended the decision to fire mr. gray and later stood up, tapped a glass and reminded the gathering that it was 25 years ago that his father had busted london newspaper unions, a seminal event in both british labor history and the historical narrative of the murdoch media kingdom, the news corporation. \n",
            " unmentioned that evening was the deepening investigation into the practice among journalists at the news of the world, another murdoch tabloid, of hacking into the voice mail of the famous. the scandal alone would not have caused james murdoch to cancel his trip to the world economic forum in davos. (it was not, as the british press would have it, rupert murdoch who was scheduled to be in davos.) rather, it was that the uproar might threaten the single biggest deal in the news corporation’s history: a $12 billion takeover bid for british sky broadcasting. the deal has been facing opposition in both the british media and the government, and some of the criticism has come from some longtime murdoch allies. \n",
            " the perennial speculation is whether james murdoch, 38, will one day run the news corporation. but the pertinent fact is that as the chairman and chief executive of its businesses in europe and asia, he already runs a large and growing part of it. if the sky transaction is approved, the businesses reporting to james murdoch would account for roughly half of the news corporation’s annual revenue. \n",
            " james murdoch has risen higher in the company than his older siblings, lachlan, 39, and elisabeth, 42, who went to work for their father and later left acrimoniously. with rupert about to turn 80, the issue of succession has taken on more importance. he may never name a sole heir; his preference, executives say, is to have all three involved. he has unsuccessfully sought to bring lachlan back to the company, but as soon as this week could announce a deal to return elisabeth to the fold, by buying her television production company, shine. \n",
            " now james faces his greatest test: whether he can put an end to the phone-hacking scandal — without the company facing more troubling revelations, an embarrassingly high amount in damages or the collapse of the takeover of sky. the news corporation already controls a 39 percent stake of sky, and james remains its chairman after serving as c.e.o. from 2003 until 2007. (the takeover, if successful, would let the news corporation finally consolidate sky’s growing profits on its balance sheet.) \n",
            " james murdoch is trying to succeed at the company his father built, but he is a very different character: more blunt, more bureaucratic and less able to smooth ruffled feathers. he has his father’s aggressiveness but not his tactical sense or temperance. \n",
            " ultimately, the deal for sky could be undone by the tabloid sensibilities of the news corporation, a heritage for which he seems to have little affection. but he faces this challenge at a time when he has become a steadier presence in the company, having emerged from a period of corporate infighting, particularly in 2009 and early 2010. then, his efforts to involve himself in news corporation entities outside his purview alienated several longtime executives and raised tensions between new york and london, according to several executives who spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain relationships with the family. \n",
            " james murdoch declined to speak on the record for this article. he put forward numerous people who know him well to speak on his behalf, and he asked others, including longtime friends from his childhood in new york city and time at harvard, not to speak. (one of his best college friends, after first agreeing to speak, e-mailed with the note: “sorry for not getting back to you earlier. as you probably figured out, the p.r. people at news corp are handling this.”) many others spoke without first seeking james’s permission. \n",
            " through nearly two dozen interviews, on and off the record, with people who have worked directly with him or are close to him personally, a portrait emerges. it suggests an aggressive, ambitious executive who has cemented his stellar reputation in the pay-television business in asia and europe, who at times has made assertive plays for expanding his power base within the company, who has nurtured a brand of conservative politics that often puts him at odds with the profit center that is fox news, and who has shown an eagerness to play in the corridors of power in ways noisier than his father’s more subtle maneuverings. \n",
            " “there’s an intensity to him,” said frank luntz, the republican pollster, who has worked for james. “the guy’s got intensity wrapped around energy.” \n",
            " that james works from a standing desk in his office in london — sitting is less efficient in getting work done — adds to the image of him as a tightly wound executive, as do his black belt in karate and his hobby of competitive cycling. so does the way he offers his business card to visitors: with a two-handed thrust, as they do in asia, where he once ran the company’s regional television business out of hong kong. and so does the episode, well told in the british press, of him showing up last april at the office of the independent, a rival paper, to berate its editor for running advertisements critical of the murdoch empire’s supposed influence in british elections. \n",
            " another business acquaintance, saad mohseni, an afghan media mogul who has worked with james in establishing farsi1, a joint venture to beam satellite television into iran, said: “he expresses himself. he swears if he needs to; he gets aggro.” \n",
            " during 2009 and into 2010 — a period that saw the exit of rupert murdoch’s longtime deputy, peter chernin — the perception within the new york headquarters of the news corporation was that james was being overly aggressive in positioning himself to be his father’s successor. \n",
            " that sense was amplified by james’s close relationship with prince walid bin talal of saudi arabia, the company’s second-largest shareholder after the murdoch family. the two men met almost nine years ago, aboard the prince’s yacht in cannes, france. the relationship blossomed during meetings in london and the middle east and culminated last year with a murdoch investment in the prince’s media company, rotana, and an interview with charlie rose in which the prince said james should succeed his father. \n",
            " the comments irritated rupert murdoch and other senior executives. rupert, according to one of the executives, felt the prince had overstepped a line, while others in the news corporation saw the comments as evidence of james trying to pressure his father on succession — even though the prince, in an interview late last year with the new york times, said he had never spoken about succession with james. \n",
            " in the interview, prince walid said rupert laughed off the charlie rose interview, telling the prince, “i am going to stay until i am 130 years of age.” \n",
            " the prince explained that “i’m not saying rupert should leave now” and that he believes james “has the full potential to succeed rupert.” \n",
            " “james is really a rupert murdoch in the making,” he added. \n",
            " while james murdoch has little interest in having his words distilled through a journalist’s pen, he is not shy about offering unfiltered views of the world. in 2009, he gave the prestigious mactaggart lecture at the edinburgh international television festival — a talk that is still recalled for its broad attack on the bbc and the public subsidies it enjoys. it was a clarion call for free markets that cited darwin, tolstoy and the international banana market. \n",
            " james took particular aim at the effect that free news from the bbc online was having on other news outlets. “dumping free, state-sponsored news on the market makes it incredibly difficult for journalism to flourish on the internet,” he said. “yet it is essential for the future of independent journalism that a fair price can be charged for news for people who value it.” \n",
            " in the fall of 2009, james decided to have the sun — which has had enormous historical influence on british parliamentary elections — switch allegiances from the labour party, led by gordon brown, to the conservative party and david cameron. the paper made the endorsement early in the election cycle, just as labour was holding its party conference. it was an aggressive move that rankled even his father, who had been close to mr. brown. \n",
            " according to one of the executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity, rupert murdoch ultimately backed mr. cameron but objected to the timing and manner of the sun’s endorsement. now that perception of closeness to the government of mr. cameron has caused trouble for the pursuit of sky, putting pressure on the government to block the transaction. (doing little to allay that concern in the british press was a dinner that james had with mr. cameron in late december, at the oxfordshire home of rebekah brooks, the chief executive of news international, the news corporation division that runs the london papers, and former editor of the sun.) \n",
            " “the phone-hacking story and this transaction have no connection at all but in the political context and in the context of the narrative of the murdochs in the u.k.,” said claire enders, a media analyst in london who owns her own firm, enders analysis. ms. enders is a vocal opponent of the sky deal, and wears her political stripes prominently. “i’m a liberal,” she said. “i’m a pacifist. i’m a feminist.” she also gave up her american citizenship in protest of the iraq war. \n",
            " “we have had 30 years of murdochs in this country, 30 years of closeness with prime ministers, ministers and senior m.p.’s,” she said. \n",
            " if you were raised by a man whose place in newspaper history is rivaled perhaps only by william randolph hearst, some people will take your measure by how much ink is in your veins. on this score, those who know james murdoch often note that he does not relish the newspaper culture the way his father does. he seems to take no delight in the company of reporters and in the sort of gossip that permeates the newspaper world and that his father both traffics in and relishes. \n",
            " “james shows no sign at all of liking journalists,” said emily bell, director of the tow center for digital journalism at columbia university and a former reporter at the guardian in london who covered the murdochs. “in fact, it’s quite the opposite.” \n",
            " she continued, “james grew up in a bubble where his experience with the press was not really running it but seeing his family picked apart by it.” \n",
            " internally, executives say james murdoch understands the future of media and the declining role of newspapers, at least in the financial sense. he has also taken a leading industry role in pushing to charge for news content online, putting the times of london behind a paywall last year. the company’s four london newspapers — the sun, the news of the world, the times and the sunday times — offered paid apps for the apple ipad before their competitors. \n",
            " “rupert is iconic for most journalists in the world because he has invested more money for a profession we adore, so to compare anyone to him is unfair,” ms. brooks, the head of news international, said in an interview in london. (she also recounted details of the january dinner.) \n",
            " ms. brooks added: “james was brought up going through the papers in the house. you can’t grow up in that household like that and not have a special place in your heart for newspapers. it is part of their heritage.” \n",
            " but james murdoch has a singularly different take on the profession that defines his father. rupert murdoch wanted to make journalism sell. james’s job is to make it pay. “that ethos has seeped into the company with everything we do,” ms. brooks said. the company, she said, now pays little attention to circulation figures, but instead speaks in the language of pay television. the preferred metric is average revenue per user. \n",
            " “when james came over from sky, he said, can you give me the data on your readers?” ms. brooks recalled, adding that now “we think about the newspaper business like a subscription business.” that means news international goes deep into market research of the sort james learned to conduct while running sky. when ms. brooks was promoted from editor of the sun to chief executive of news international, james insisted that she attend the london school of economics, a request that she said never would have been made by rupert murdoch. \n",
            " but what james murdoch did inherit from his father is a corporate self-image of the brash outsider crashing the establishment — a pose that james maintains despite being born into one of the wealthiest media families on earth. in a 2009 interview with der spiegel, the german magazine, james said, “we are always the outsider, as a challenger who tries to be better and more efficient than the established players.” \n",
            " james murdoch joined the news corporation in 1996, after the company bought his critically acclaimed yet money-losing record label, rawkus records. he had dropped out of harvard to run the label, whose best-known artist was mos def. \n",
            " james’s persona at the time would never have predicted the technocratic, management-school style he later adopted. “if you had to stereotype james at the time, he was anti all that,” said jason hirschhorn, a former president of myspace, another news corporation holding, who went to high school with james at horace mann, a prep school in the riverdale section of the bronx. he recalled meeting james for the first time: “he was wearing converse high-tops, military shorts, his head was buzzed and he had an earring.” \n",
            " it wasn’t until 2007, when james took charge of the businesses in europe and asia, that he had responsibility for any newspapers. he had spent most of his career overseeing pay-television businesses, first in asia and then, for four years, as the chief executive of sky. \n",
            " to chart james murdoch’s career path is to gain a view of the news corporation’s vast global reach — a presence that goes far beyond the fox news-dominated perspective that many americans have of it. of course, in the united states and london, the news corporation is a power unto itself, in some cases more powerful than the so-called establishment it professes to disdain. but elsewhere, from india to italy, from germany to iran, its self-narrative as the outsider is actually true. \n",
            " in italy, the company’s sky italia has taken on establishment media in the form of mediaset, the family empire of prime minister silvio berlusconi. the news corporation invested about $1.9 billion in italy before sky italia turned around, and analysts expect the unit to make about 200 million euros this year. \n",
            " “i know the news corporation in the u.s. and the u.k. is considered the big brother,” said maria latella, a magazine editor in milan who hosts a sunday-morning talk show on sky. in italy, she said, the news corporation represents “the dissenting voice, the voice of freedom.” mr. berlusconi has called the news corporation in italy a friend of the “left.” \n",
            " sky italia’s investments in original productions, particularly the gangster drama “romanzo criminale,” about italian mobsters in the 1970s and ’80s and their links to state intelligence agencies, have been praised in the press for revitalizing the italian creative scene. at a multiplex in rome last year, james murdoch was host for the premiere of the show’s second season and used it partly as an occasion to speak about the country’s economic doldrums and its government controls over the economy. \n",
            " and in munich, after facing doubts from those who said germans would not warm to paying for television, and after investing nearly $1.5 billion over the last three years, news corporation executives see glimmers of hope that sky deutschland is turning around as sky italia did. the german sky still loses money, but it is no longer losing subscribers, having added more than 130,000 in the fourth quarter last year. \n",
            " in 2000, at the age of 27, james murdoch was dispatched to hong kong to run the news corporation’s asian television service, star, which was ailing at the time. it was there that he first made a major mark on the company. when he arrived, star’s ambitions were to serve audiences across the region, in china, taiwan, indonesia, india and so on. \n",
            " china was becoming increasingly resistant to foreign media, and james decided to focus almost solely on india — long before american media companies were clamoring to increase their business there. the company’s channels in india — where it also owns a stake in a satellite platform — are now the most-watched in the nation, and it is the fastest-growing market among the businesses james oversees. \n",
            " according to media partners asia, a consulting firm, the news corporation’s asian businesses will generate $1 billion in revenue and $250 million in operating profit this year. when james murdoch joined star, the news corporation was losing money in asia. (this year, executives say, the company’s television business in india could generate more profit than news international over all. it is a stark metric that underscores the declining importance of newspapers, and the rising importance of pay tv, in the company’s general financial health.) \n",
            " james murdoch’s success at star did little to blunt accusations of nepotism when, in 2003, he was appointed chief executive of sky in london. “the press was still calling him the guy with the earring who was investing in indie music and had dropped out of harvard,” said jan hall, who runs the jca group, a recruitment firm, and was hired by the sky board to conduct the c.e.o. search that ultimately picked james. \n",
            " “i really tried hard to get away from people who had reasons to be kind to him, and no one said anything different,” ms. hall said. “fundamentally, they all felt he got the genes — the rupert genes.” \n",
            " in his first investor presentation at sky, james murdoch laid out bold investment plans and set a goal of increasing the number of subscribers from 7.4 million to close to 10 million. sky’s share price promptly plummeted nearly 20 percent. but by the time he left, in 2007, sky’s subscriber numbers had soared, and james was credited with improving technology and revitalizing the sky brand. \n",
            " james murdoch has displayed a knack and interest for aspects of the media business that little concern his father — particularly marketing and communications. early on at sky, he hired mr. luntz to conduct market research and focus groups. at one session, in west london, a group of people were discussing what the murdoch name meant to them. watching behind a mirror were james and other executives. \n",
            " “the murdoch name has detractors, not just in america but in britain,” mr. luntz said. “some were very harsh, so blunt were their attacks. ten sky executives watched in embarrassment as person after person tore into the murdoch name.” \n",
            " then james stepped into the room and engaged them about their comments. “he went in and they were shocked,” mr. luntz said. “most c.e.o.’s would not step into a room of hostile customers.” \n",
            " according to mr. luntz’s polling, the sky slogan that was developed under james’s leadership, “believe in better,” has sometimes been seen as the second-most-powerful corporate motto, after microsoft’s “where do you want to go today?” and in 2009, management today magazine named sky as britain’s most-admired company. \n",
            " even ms. enders, the analyst who is critical of the sky takeover bid, said of james murdoch: “he is, in my opinion, as it relates to bskyb, a business genius.” \n",
            " along the way, james murdoch has epitomized the same conservative temperament as his father when it comes to free markets. but on other issues, particularly environmental ones, he is at odds with modern-day conservatism. \n",
            " in london, he holds dinners that bring together environmental advocates, academics and executives. in the summer of 2008, james held a dinner for fred krupp, the head of the environmental defense fund, an advocacy group based in new york. the event was attended by boris johnson, the mayor of london, and tony hayward, then the chief executive of bp. \n",
            " james murdoch told the group that the news corporation’s own environmental efforts had saved it $35 million. on such matters, he has cast himself as a teddy roosevelt-style conservative and has sought to link environmental protection with sound business practice. \n",
            " the liberal media watchdog media matters has crusaded against fox news’s coverage of the climate issue, having released e-mails it obtained last year in which a fox editor told staff members: “given the controversy over the veracity of climate change data ... ... we should refrain from asserting that the planet has warmed (or cooled) in any given period without immediately pointing out that such theories are based upon data that critics have called into question.” \n",
            " james murdoch’s views raise the question of whether he would interfere with fox news’s coverage if he were running the news corporation. in an interview published in 2009, he said: “all of the climate-prediction models suggest we’re on the worst-case trajectory, and some cases worse than the worst case. that’s my depressing take on it.” \n",
            " on other stages, particularly at the edinburgh lecture, he has been a loud proponent of deregulated markets and laissez-faire economics, making him a lightning rod in certain corners of the british media. \n",
            " “he became a champion for the free market in the media, and not everyone likes that,” ms. hall said. “not everyone wants a free market as he would champion.” \n",
            " the company’s iranian venture also appeals to james as a way to spread the gospel of freedom and openness into a closed society. executives say it is profitable — advertisers include a ski resort outside tehran — and the company plans a second channel, aimed at iranian women. \n",
            " farsi1 is also completing a deal to carry reruns of “the oprah winfrey show,” the last new episodes of which are being filmed this year now that ms. winfrey has started her own cable network, and is searching for a farsi-speaking woman to be the voice of oprah. \n",
            " the deal is awaiting word on an application from cbs — which distributed ms. winfrey’s show — to the office of foreign asset control of the treasury department, to gain a waiver from sanctions on iran. \n",
            " as father and son left rupert murdoch’s london apartment on that late january night to have dinner with the staff of the sun, a reporter from the independent newspaper was outside, waiting to ask about the latest in the phone-hacking scandal. such was the magnitude in the british press of rupert murdoch’s visit to london. \n",
            " the independent even kept a tally of the words that nine national newspapers devoted to the scandal the next day: 12,585 in total, with the left-leaning guardian leading the way with 4,703. the sun devoted 41 words to the story. \n",
            " ian hargreaves, a former editor of the independent and now a professor at cardiff university, wrote that week: “murdoch, and his ambitious son james, have put themselves at the center of public controversy in a manner which, in their own eyes, must represent serious miscalculation.” \n",
            " the argument that james and his executives mishandled the investigation is commonly held not just among some journalists but also in the highest reaches of the news corporation. executives paid out-of-court settlements, and initially blamed one rogue reporter for the whole affair, even though the news of the world has said it has since dismissed an editor after finding “material evidence”’ linking him to allegations that it intercepted celebrities’ phone messages. although james was not overseeing news international when the hacking occurred, he did approve the settlements and is responsible now for putting the scandal to rest. \n",
            " the sky broadcasting deal, meanwhile, hangs in the balance. the news corporation is waiting to see whether the deal will be referred to britain’s competition commission for a review that could take six to nine months. if that happens, the news corporation would have to decide whether to simply pull the offer, as executives suggest it might. \n",

            " china is the star of this authoritarian international, with its robust growth guided by a government that quashed the 1989 tiananmen square protests but now wins plaudits even from many western business leaders who concede that it is often better at getting things done than querulous democracies. \n",
            " but just as the authoritarian international drew strength from the chinese model and the so-called “beijing consensus” it inspired, the uprisings in egypt and tunisia have been unsettling for the world’s unelected rulers. \n",
            " “when you see somebody like chávez in venezuela reaching out to somebody like ahmadinejad it is clear these authoritarian regimes are forming an alliance that helps them to maintain their control,” aryeh neier, the president of the open society foundations, said, referring to president hugo chávez of venezuela and president mahmoud ahmadinejad of iran. “if i were hu jintao,” he said of the chinese president, “i would be nervous at this moment.” \n",

            " mohamed a. el-erian, chief executive of the bond giant pimco, is the son of an egyptian diplomat, holds an egyptian passport, and spent much of his childhood in egypt. he is an expert in emerging markets, where regime change is the norm, and he spent christmas with his family in egypt. but he, like everyone else, was taken by surprise. \n",
            " “these processes aren’t linear,” mr. el-erian said. “nothing happens, and nothing happens and nothing happens, and then everything happens. the protest movement got ahead of policy makers in both egypt and the west.” \n",
            " that was certainly true last week at the annual meeting of the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, which largely ignored the world-changing events in the middle east in its long-set official program. yet egypt was the talk of the corridors and cafes, and, apart from the arab participants, some of the most riveted were the russians. \n",
            " that is because, as the russian opposition leader boris y. nemtsov said by telephone from moscow this week, “many in russia are drawing direct parallels between mubarak and putin.” \n",
            " a key similarity between the egyptian leader and prime minister valdimir v. putin, in the view of mr. nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister and provincial governor, is that “both are corrupt regimes and both regimes have been about the enrichment of a small group of people around the leader.” \n",
            " mr. el-erian agrees that the gap between the super-privileged and everyone else was an achilles’ heel of the mubarak regime. \n",
            " that weakness was invisible — or deemed irrelevant — to many because of the growth of the economy overall. \n",
            " but the lesson of history is that the most fragile authoritarian regimes aren’t necessarily the poorest ones. they are often those where the economy is doing reasonably well, but where gains are unequally shared. hence, for example, the complaints in tunisia about the enrichment of leila trabelsi, wife of the deposed president,  and her family. \n",
            " “in egypt, there was an income distribution problem, even though the economy was growing impressively,” mr. el-erian said. “but there wasn't enough trickle down.” \n",
            " china’s mandarins are seen by some as the world’s smartest authoritarians. one example might be the information war that china has waged around the events in egypt, restricting online access to independent news while in the official media emphasizing the “chaos” attendant upon the uprising. \n",
            " another is that chinese leaders are conscious of their vulnerability to public perceptions that communist party rule is about enriching the cadres, rather than generating prosperity as a whole. that is why the most surprising story out of china recently was the conviction of li qiming, son of a senior police official, who ran over and killed a young woman. \n",
            " at some level, the russians have listened. speaking in davos before the uprising in egypt had gathered true force, president dmitri a. medvedev said: “what happened in tunisia, i think, is quite a substantial lesson to learn for any authorities. the authorities must not simply sit in their convenient chairs but develop themselves together with the society. when the authorities don’t catch up with the development of the society, don’t meet the aspiration of the people, the outcome is very sad.” \n",
            " mr. nemtsov doesn’t think that russia’s rulers will necessarily heed that advice. russia has oil, he noted, “but the russian regime is so corrupt it requires the price of oil to constantly increase. oil won’t save putin.” \n",
            " for the west, one conclusion must be that even though authoritarian plutocrats can be easier to work with than dissidents — a few weeks ago, hillary rodham clinton, the u.s. secretary of state, has spoken publicly about her warm personal friendship with mr. mubarak and his wife, suzanne, who has upheld women’s rights — staying close to the activists is not just morally justifiable, it is pragmatic, too. \n",
            " carl bildt, the swedish foreign minister, wrote in an e-mail that one indirect consequence of the uprising in egypt will be that “western governments will be more alert to the need to reach out to civil society in these societies and be more proactive on some sort of democracy agenda.” \n",
            " he sent that message from warsaw, where he was working to support the beleaguered opposition in belarus. \n",
            " indeed, the hardest part of overthrowing authoritarian regimes is often the day after. “if you look at the most successful transitions — poland, mexico, taiwan — they’ve been long hauls,” said lucan way, a political scientist at the university of toronto. “you want there to be established oppositions, and that doesn’t happen in a two-week period.” \n",

            "the return of confidence in business to pre-crisis levels, confirming a snapshot survey released six months ago, was driven by only a few countries, with a re-bound in the us erasing the “trust discount” us companies had suffered since the iraq war, said richard edelman, chief executive.\n",
            "despite strong recoveries in the netherlands, italy and spain and a weaker showing among the brics and other growth markets, trust in the traditional economic powerhouses of north america and western europe is still lagging behind mexico, indonesia, india, china and brazil. \n",
            "trust has rebounded in almost every industry except banking, which remained at 45 per cent globally, down from 56 per cent in 2007 and 2008. in the us, uk and germany trust in banks plumbed new depths, as financial institutions began to repay bail-out funds but ran into fresh criticism of bonus policies. \n",
            "trust in us banks stands at 29 per cent, down from 36 per cent in the 2009 survey and 69 per cent a year earlier. “us banking was the number three most trusted industry in 2007. now it’s second lowest after insurance,” mr edelman said.\n",
            "media companies missed the trust rebound, but even blogs and recommendations from friends on social networks are no longer given the credence they enjoyed. “the more people think there’s a filter between them and information, the less they like it,” said neal flieger, chairman of strategyone, the edelman research company which conducted the survey.\n",
            "the survey of 4,875 people in 22 countries, aged between 25 and 64 and in the top quartile for income, shows continued scepticism about companies’ long-term business practices. seventy per cent of those polled, between september and november, expected to see a return to business as usual in time.\n",
            "the trust barometer, which has helped set the tone for wef meetings in recent years, also draws the clearest picture yet of an emerging “stakeholder society”, in which delivering financial returns for shareholders is no longer seen as executives’ sole priority. \n",
            "just over half of those polled saw all stakeholders – investors, customers, employees, government and “society at large” – as equally important. as trust in ngos continued to rise, a clear majority also said they were more likely to trust companies that worked with ngos to tackle global issues.\n",
            "the findings reinforced last year’s survey’s support for “private sector diplomacy” in which business takes on responsibilities once seen as the preserve of ngos and governments, mr edelman said. “there is a recognition that business can do. there is still scepticism that government can do.” \n",
            "another consolation for companies around the world is that ceos are more trusted than a year ago, although independent experts such as academics and financial analysts continue to gain weight over other sources such as social media or television news coverage.\n",
            "“in some countries, transparent business practices are now seen as more important than making good products and services,” mr edelman said. “in 2008 trust was a ‘nice to have’. now corporate reputation is as much based on trust as transparency as the quality of your products.”\n",

            "martin dickson: the world economic forum takes place this year against a more encouraging backdrop than 12 months ago, when the major issue facing those heading for davos was how deep would be the economic downturn induced by the credit crunch – a severe recession, or something even worse.\n",
            "in the event, massive fiscal intervention by governments around the world means economies have recovered more rapidly than expected. but there remain huge questions about the durability of the recovery, when and how monetary policy should be tightened, sovereign default risk, whether new bubbles are being inflated, and how the financial system should be regulated.\n",
            "there are also major geopolitical issues to contend with. the economic crisis has produced a marked shift in power from the west to the largest emerging markets, led by china, but this is accompanied by a great deal of friction, as underlined by china’s controversial role at the copenhagen climate talks, by google’s threat to withdraw from china, and by western concern about the valuation of the renminbi.\n",
            "the theme chosen for davos this year is to “rethink, redesign and rebuild” the world after a crisis that has shaken faith in many of its core institutions and ideas. but how realistic is it to think anything of substantial value will come out the gathering?\n",
            "let me first turn to gillian tett, a longtime davos observer. gillian, what do you think the mood will be like this year?\n",
            "gillian tett: i would imagine the main mood is going to be one of relief in part, because this time last year when people were gathering in davos, there was a feeling that they were on the brink of armageddon. the banks were melting down, or had been melting down in the wake of the lehman brothers collapse, but just as importantly, real economies were suffering very badly indeed and there was a sense of real panic afoot.\n",
            "a year on, the mood has moved from one of survival to one of strategy. there is a sense that the climate has improved dramatically but, of course, many of the big problems have still only really been papered over, and there are still some very big challenges ahead. this year’s davos could be particularly interesting because to solve these problems you are going to need to examine issues such as the interface between the public and private sector, and the shift of power from the west to the east. one of the great things about davos is that, irrespective of all the hot air and the rhetoric that can sometimes seem a bit empty, there is actually a chance for the public and private sector, and the east and west, to meet. and so some of the debates could be pretty interesting.\n",
            "md: chris, what do you see as the main economic themes facing davos delegates this year? \n",
            "chris giles: last year, everything that seemed to be happening was the worst possible outcome that could have been predicted. the politicians who were there seemed to disagree about the main response they should have to the economic crisis. but they managed to pull things together pretty quickly after davos; they stopped blaming each other and all came up with a pretty unified strategy of fiscal and monetary intervention, and no protectionism, so things have gone a lot better than anyone was predicting this time last year.\n",
            "now we can start thinking about how we deal with some of the hangover issues of the crisis. the fiscal hangover was obviously very big, and that is going to be a major theme, but, equally, there is the regulatory hangover in terms of financial markets, and also the question of whether we really are on the verge of sustained economic growth, or whether it has just been papered over, as gillian was suggesting. unfortunately, this year we are not necessarily going to find things are fantastically better than we dared hope, but we might well feel that we are beginning to get to grips with some of the reckoning.\n",
            "the big global issue, of course, will be whether we can get to a situation where some of the stresses in the global economy will improve, in particular the trading imbalances, which contributed to the circumstances that underlay a lot of the lending that caused the financial crisis.\n",
            "the dialogue between china and the us and the currency issue is just as interesting as it ever was, because, frankly, the g20 so far has parked the issue. there has been a lot of warm rhetoric about intentions to have a framework for balanced and sustainable growth, but we haven’t really got there yet.\n",
            "gt: chris has absolutely put his finger on it by saying “the reckoning”. i think this davos really will be about trying to face up to the reckoning, to quantify it, and try and float some ideas about how to deal with it, and it’s going to be tough.\n",
            "md: gideon, addressing the shift from west to east and china’s position in particular, how is that going to be reflected in davos?\n",
            "gideon rachman: the body language and the atmospherics between the americans and the chinese will be watched very closely. the americans were largely absent last year because the obama administration had just taken power, so they probably will be slightly more in evidence this year. the big question on everyone’s mind is whether this crisis has really marked a permanent geopolitical change, with china now more assertive, and america less able to run the show. \n",
            "the years after 1991 were the unipolar moment. everyone has been waiting for that to end, and the general perception, certainly outside the us, is that it is happening now. and we are trying to work out what this new world will look like. will we move to a more co-operative us/china relationship? or are the two sides in fact going to clash as china becomes more assertive and the us puts more pressure on china over issues such as its currency? \n",
            "and where does everyone else fit in? where do the “swing powers” – the brazils, the russias, the indias come down on big debates like climate change and currency? it is a very uncertain period and, therefore, very interesting.\n",
            "md: how is that likely to be reflected in delegations and body language at davos?\n",
            "gr: the programme is still being formed because the real vips tend not to show their hand until the last moment as to when they actually show up. but let us say there is a debate on global economic imbalances, and the us and china are well represented. what people say there will be listened to incredibly carefully – not just the detail of the policy, but whether they can keep what they call the spirit of davos, which is meant to be conciliatory; the idea that we all get together and talk in rational terms, and that we have shared interests. \n",
            "generally, this works, but it broke down last year in a session on the middle east when the turkish prime minister had a disagreement with the israelis and walked out. this was entertaining for observers because it was such a violation of the ‘spirit of davos’. when it comes to the us, the chinese generally are very low key, but they can lose it if they get pushed on the currency.\n",
            "gt: some of the debates about banking reform could be pretty heated, too.\n",
            "md: banking reform: let’s get on to that. patrick, we’ve spoken about increased regulation, and nowhere is that likely to be more the case than in the banking industry. we’ve also seen the obama government making moves to impose a new levy on the banking system. how do you see the main financial themes shaping up at davos?\n",
            "patrick jenkins: regulation will be what every banker in attendance is going to be talking about, and there will probably be a fair clutch of senior people this year, in contrast to last year when there were a lot of no-shows. \n",
            "after the publication of the basel committee on banking supervision’s proposals for how banks should be regulated, regulation will be uppermost on everyone’s mind. some of the proposals are extremely contentious and everyone who saw them was quite shocked by how extreme they were, particularly in relation to some of the capital requirements and the strictness of the liquidity proposals. a lot of bankers will use the opportunity to try to agree some kind of industry consensus over what the response should be. and it wouldn’t be a surprise if, by the time that the consultation period for those proposals ends in april, we’ve got some real push-back on many of them.\n",
            "particularly sensitive are things like the rules governing minority subsidiaries of banks. the us levy – not to mention the uk bonus tax and other measures employed across the world to recover some of the cost of the bail-outs – are going to be on everybody’s lips as well.\n",
            "md: i imagine that a question of whether banks have just become too big to fail and, therefore, hard to regulate, will be an important public policy debate there. the obama levy seems to go some way to addressing this issue. how do you think that will play out?\n",
            "pj: it will also be a big subject for discussion, but it is not as advanced as some of the more detailed capital liquidity proposals that would apply to all banks. \n",
            "it’s something that the committees on this – the basel committee in particular – have not yet been charged with. it is still at the policy level because no one can really work out how in practical terms you deal with the whole issue of “too big to fail”. so, yes, policymakers will probably be discussing this with great fervour in davos this year.\n",
            "md: that gives us some general introductory thoughts about the main themes. can i come back to chris and the global economy? one of the big themes of the moment is exit strategies when the economies are actually showing signs of sustained recovery. what do you see as the major debating points there?\n",
            "cg: the main debating point is the balance between fiscal and monetary policy. monetary authorities across europe – the european central bank and the bank of england – are very wary. they want the fiscal authorities to get their fiscal houses in order. they’re holding out a carrot saying: “we think our monetary policy is working pretty well” – whether or not it is remains very much up for debate, but that’s their line at least – so if you get your fiscal house in order, we will probably not be raising interest rates that quickly, though we might stop any more of our unorthodox policies, whether credit easing in the federal reserve’s case, quantitative easing in the bank of england’s case, or enhanced credit support from the ecb. these are all very similar actions designed to boost the central bank’s balance sheet and shovel money into the economy.\n",
            "that tension between policymakers is particularly ripe in countries like the uk where there will soon be an election, so the politicians are not necessarily being honest with the public – or with central bankers – about what they are going to be doing over the next 4-5 years. the big exit strategy debate is how you co-ordinate between fiscal and monetary policy in a world where you have central banks that are at least nominally independent and so can go around stamping their boots.\n",
            "generally, we think that’s a good idea, but it gets difficult when things are really tough. we don’t know how effective monetary policy is at the moment. we don’t know how sustained the recovery; and we don’t know what effect tightening the fiscal position will have. we don’t really know how effective the fiscal stimulus has been; and we don’t know whether the economic recovery last year was essentially because emerging markets were unaffected by the crisis.\n",
            "all these things are up for grabs still. until people are confident that they know the answers, they’re likely to delay, which is why we will see a lot of people waiting for someone else to make the difficult decisions.\n",
            "gt: this year’s davos could be interesting because questions like social cohesion and the functioning of western political institutions are crucial for the type of themes that chris has touched upon. to put it crudely, can the governments get their head around these enormous debts? can they find a way to deleverage their economies without having some kind of revolt on the streets or creating some kind of bond market scare? because the challenges that are facing governments right now are not merely about the hard macroeconomic numbers, they are also about possibly severe political and social challenges.\n",
            "gr: i agree, and, as gillian says, big ideas that people at davos have more or less taken for granted are now up for grabs again, and the biggest of them all is globalisation. davos is a sort of festival of globalisation, and the basis on which all these people could meet was, in a sense, a shared belief in certain things; whatever their political differences, they all believed in more trade, more investment. and now, suddenly, there is an open question as to whether it is still true that globalisation works well for all the participants at davos. anti-free-trade sentiment is shooting up in the us, and people are talking about inequality effects, and also the shift in the global balance of power. the americans are beginning to think, well, maybe we’ve created our newest and biggest rival.\n",
            "gt: but it’s not only globalisation that’s being called into question. the holy trinity of davos ideals was faith in globalisation, innovation and free market capitalism. and, at best, faith in innovation – unfettered innovation – and free market capitalism is also shrivelling, which could inject a very interesting tenor into the debate.\n",
            "cg: one of the real difficulties is unemployment, which has been much more of an issue in the us than it has in europe. it is the people who are not at davos, those who feel disenfranchised and who were not bailed out in the crisis, who are very angry that the rich were bailed out. this all goes back to the mandate governments have for engaging in processes like davos. globalisation is, as gideon was saying, up in the air. even though unemployment is not on the programme, it is likely to feature in any debate where americans are present, and because it’s such an overriding issue, it is going to dominate the way that democratic governments try to address issues like banking regulation, and it is what has been pushing the us administration in recent days into the banking levies.\n",
            "pj: one theme that is going to stretch right across the whole of davos, linking private sector bankers on the one side and the macroeconomists on the other, is what the bankers will argue is a danger of excessive regulation in the short term; that economies will be plunged into far greater chaos if banks are lumbered with tougher regulation, particularly on the capital side, but also on the liquidity side. basically, the cost of lending will just become prohibitive. \n",
            "md: at a time when the global economy is very delicately poised, restriction of credit could make matters worse, even though there is a mood of punishing the bankers.\n",
            "cg: i’m sure bankers will be blackmailing everyone else and pushing it hard, but i think there will be quite a bit of push-back as well. the most important thing, given that the economic crisis was caused by a crisis of confidence after a financial crisis – and i can say that the policymakers will be pushing this very hard – is to ensure we don’t have another one of those. that’s more important than some years of subdued growth in case there’s a little bit less credit around.\n",
            "gt: one of the joys of davos is that you do have voices coming from all over the world. i, for one, hope that the japanese really speak up, because they have an awful lot to say right now, not merely about how to cope – or not – with deleveraging, but also on the unemployment that chris was talking about earlier. after japan’s financial crisis, when jobs began to grow again they tended to be temporary jobs, often at low wage levels, and that had quite an impact on consumer sentiment for a long time. that is the type of interesting little geopolitical parallel that has a lot of implications for, say, the us, but might not necessarily be that obvious until you actually get people on the same platform trying to share experiences. right now there is a need to look back, not just at history, but across the globe to see how to deal with some of these problems.\n",
            "gr: patrick’s comments about how the regulatory debate is likely to be front and centre this year connect very closely to another central theme of davos: global governance. the people who turn up at davos, particularly the politicians, are increasingly finding that the problems they face – whether it’s climate change or banking regulation – cannot be dealt with simply at a national level. what each country does affects the others.\n",
            "regulation is an obvious issue. the first question governments ask is, “what can we do about these bankers”, and the second question is, “but what if we do it and the others don’t and we lose business?” which leads on to, “what global governance structures do we have, and do they work?” there is a slightly alarmed feeling that international political institutions haven’t kept pace with international economics, and so we have all these cross-cutting international problems, but no really effective means of regulating them. the g20, which has been referred to as the new kid on the block, is as yet unproven.\n",
            "md: the g20 last year seemed to do quite well in coming up with some policy responses agreed between developed and developing countries. why is it potentially not so effective now?\n",
            "gr: i think that the g20 certainly did better than some sceptics – and i would include myself among them – thought a year ago, and the london summit looks in retrospect like a turning point in sentiment. one of the reasons that it worked was that it sent a signal that the americans, the chinese, the indians could all sit around and talk about this, and that in itself was important. but they have avoided very difficult arguments simply by not addressing certain key issues. so, as chris said, the whole question of global imbalances was just not on the table there.\n",
            "pj: i would agree absolutely. when it comes to the micro aspects of the regulation of the banks, the g20 seemed to usher in an encouraging sequence of events that has seen the financial stability board and then the basel committee actually press on with the detail of how you regulate the global banks. although a lot of politicians might complain about how long it has actually taken, and that we haven’t yet seen a concrete change of much magnitude, nonetheless, what’s been done in terms of setting the framework is quite an achievement.\n",
            "what will be really of concern is whether that momentum can be continued, particularly with regards to applying these regulations on a truly global basis. historically, the theory behind global banking rules as applied by the basel committee has been a nonsense, because it has not been applied in the us. so us banks have operated under completely different rules. there are currently encouraging signs that the us will adopt much of what is being talked about in terms of new regulation now, but the real test will be whether there are encouraging noises coming out of both us bankers and us policymakers.\n",
            "md: finance is obviously an area where there is a great need for global agreement, with each centre saying if we do it and others don’t, we will be left less competitive.\n",
            "pj: it’s quite interesting that we had a lot of accusations that the uk government and the financial services authority, the uk regulator, moved too fast, creating uneven playing fields. but in fact, other jurisdictions have followed, maybe with not exactly the same type of thing, but within a few weeks of the uk bonus tax, the obama levy has been announced in the us, which may be a bit more sophisticated in the way it’s structured, but effectively, the amount of money that the banks will have to pay as a result of the us levy is about the same as they might have to pay in the uk. \n",
            "gt: one of the points that patrick makes is how davos is one of the few places where bankers can bump into each other as well as regulators in a pretty casual way. these days, if all the world’s big bankers got together in a room, it would look pretty darn suspicious, and similarly, when regulators get together, again, it tends to look very suspicious. but i wouldn’t be at all surprised if some bankers and regulators use the davos meeting to try and either thrash out some policies, or to try and present a more united front.\n",
            "pj: many reformers might hope for them to come together and create a positive cartel around the issue of pay. historically, there has been a great fear of any single bank changing the parameters of their pay structures around bonuses for fear of just being uncompetitive versus rivals. \n",
            "privately, many bank chief executives say there’s nothing they’d like more than to be able to reduce the proportion of revenues they pay out to their bankers, but they fear doing that because those bankers would be poached. given how much that is in the public domain at the moment, it may well be a big subject for them.\n",
            "md: can i come back to global governance, or lack of it, and the g20? if not the g20, then what? the g2? but relations between china and the us seem to be getting increasingly fractious.\n",
            "gr: it is not clear that either side has completely signed up to the g2. the americans are wary of it, because they question whether it is in their interests to exclude fellow democracies like the european union and japan.\n",
            "the chinese appear to have a similarly ambivalent attitude. on the one hand, many feel that their time has come and that they are now the other great power that the us has to deal with. on the other, it isn’t yet an equal relationship. of course, china has the whip hand in certain respects because of its purchase of us debt, but in other ways, america is a huge global military power, and china is not. the american economy is still much larger than that of china. certainly, the famous date that goldman sachs has predicted that the chinese economy will become larger than that of the us is, i believe, 2027. it’s not yet a relationship of equals.\n",
            "md: when we talk about global imbalances, we are talking in large measure about the renminbi, and, unless it’s revalued over the coming year, there could potentially be big pressures building up in the us for greater protectionism. how much of a threat is that, and how might it be addressed?\n",
            "cg: it’s an ongoing threat. we’ve had little spats over tyres and whatnot around the world, and there has been an increase in protectionism, but it’s been very minor. this is a real success of global governance, in fact, where old-fashioned multilateral agreements dating back a very long way put great limits on tariffs.\n",
            "where it will continue to be difficult is in the fact of china versus europe and america on trade, but probably not this year, because china can boast that its current account surplus has fallen very rapidly in the past year. but as i said earlier, this is likely to be due in large part because they’ve invested very heavily domestically in their exporting industries, and we haven’t really seen consumption growing yet. while you can have a very long debate on whether the currency or the domestic structure of the chinese economy is the reason that consumers aren’t spending, they haven’t got their social security system right, which means households save too much. unless the world sorts out this problem at some point, it will blow up again. this is a lasting scar and it’s been a scar on the global landscape for a very long time.\n",
            "gr: one of the things i’ll be looking out for in davos is whether protectionism is becoming politically respectable again. there used to be nobody at davos who could say, “yes, i believe in tariffs”. but now you are seeing paul krugman, a nobel laureate, writing columns saying we should impose tariffs on chinese exports. it will be very interesting if we see the debate changing at davos, because the intellectual debate could be a precursor to a policy shift.\n",
            "gt: another issue i’d like to see debated, or i’ll be watching out for, is if people start drawing parallels between the chinese and japanese economies and start asking whether the current pattern of growth in china looks uncannily similiar to japan three or four decades ago, and whether that has ominous implications.\n",
            "md: in terms of lack of sustainability?\n",
            "gt: yes, in terms of the degree to which you have an enormous expansion of infrastructure, and a financial system that is very focused on supporting industry.\n",
            "cg: the real problem is that every country wants net exports to be driving its recovery. \n",
            "gt: it is one of the reasons people keep clutching at the brics idea, that brazil, russia, india and china will help western economies to keep growing because they can export but, of course, as chris says, countries like china want to keep exporting too, and that really is a conundrum.\n",
            "to come back to the question about the huge debts that governments are now facing, if they can’t all export their way into rapid growth, then the only way they’re going to really tackle those debt burdens will be through a lot of belt tightening or inflation, and both of those are pretty unpalatable. the other option is, of course, through defaults, and that’s the kind of thing that is also pretty taboo as far as the davos debate is concerned. but it may not be quite so taboo in reality.\n",
            "gr: the sessions on the euro will be very interesting. there are always a few special europe and single currency sessions, and maybe that’s going to be the next leg of the crisis. if greece suddenly can’t service its debt, what does that mean for the single currency? how does the european union cope? \n",
            "md: europe more generally has been looking distinctly less confident of late in an international context. at copenhagen, it was basically ignored in the final agreement, such as it was. an eu official was saying only this week that the eu’s role in the world has diminished, yet davos is a conference in europe, devised by europeans, with a european feel to it. \n",
            "gr: maybe the copenhagen and davos experiences are rather similar, and europe’s role is simply to provide the conference hall and get out, because it’s not very central to these debates. but there is a slight european crisis of confidence, first because the kind of theatrics of copenhagen weren’t good for europe, but also such a mess was made of the appointment of the new president and foreign minister of the eu. the eu is still the largest economy in the world, bigger than the us and china. but it does not punch its political weight, and a couple of nobodies have been appointed as the president and foreign minister, who people in europe haven’t even heard of, let alone the rest of the world. that’s been a blow to confidence. there’s a sense that europe has missed its moment.\n",
            "pj: the one exception to that is in financial services, because we’ve seen some very interesting moves. if you consider, for example, the break-ups of various banks, or certainly penalties for state aid that have been imposed by brussels on the bailed-out banks – that was a pretty potent show of force by brussels. certainly, it was felt so by the banks that had been bailed out.\n",
            "also, the basel committee is setting the agenda for global regulation, and the eu, through the so-called ‘cebs committee’, which works in tandem with basel. and, of course, lord turner, chairman of the fsa, has been central to the agenda-setting for that area. in some senses, certainly within banking, europe does have a large role to play.\n",
            "gr: as a market, europe is too big to ignore, so that on competition policy, there was a great moment for brussels when it was able to block a merger between two american companies, ge and honeywell. there are areas where europe acts as one and where its economic weight matters and, therefore, it can be a kind of regulatory superpower to some extent. perhaps i was a bit unfair, because at the g20 as well, the europeans have been important and have managed to secure an outlandish number of places around the table. so they’re not a busted flush, but you’re right – confidence is low at the moment.\n",

            "the labour market has done pretty well in europe. spain is obviously a very big exception to that, but germany and france are looking rather better, which at least suggests that european companies expect the downturn to be temporary, because they’ve been hoarding labour.\n",

            "but things seem quite bad after the discovery of the second iranian nuclear facility. iran itself is much less internally stable and, therefore, even harder to deal with. obama came in with his policy of outreach, which has gone nowhere, so he’s fallen back on tougher sanctions, which is more or less what bush was going for. but he does not have russian or chinese backing. so it’s pretty deadlocked, but in a rather dangerous way.\n",
            "the other flashpoint people will look to is afghanistan. president hamid karzai is a davos stalwart, and in previous years he’s been regarded as a bit of a hero because he is very plausible on the international stage. but he is a seriously tarnished figure after the debacle of the afghan presidential elections. it will be interesting to see how high anxiety levels are about afghanistan; whether now that obama has finally made his announcement and we know the surge is in place, people are feeling calmer, or whether there’s a sense that actually this is the last throw of the dice.\n",
            "md: and how will climate change feature this year?\n",
            "gr: climate change is a big thing at davos. it’s one of those issues that – without wishing to be too cynical – everybody can sound concerned and float ideas about, but few advances are made. this year it might be more acrimonious and, therefore, more interesting because of the apparent failure of copenhagen, and the sense that the consensus that climate change is a big problem we have all got to solve is beginning to fray a little around the edges.\n",
            "md: how relevant at the end of the day is davos as an institution to solving any of these problems that we’ve been talking about? is it anything more than an alpine talking shop; a chance for big egos to rub shoulders with other big egos?\n",
            "gr: it’s definitely that, but there’s a distinction to be made between the public and the private davos. a lot of the sessions are fun and so on, but there’s almost a sort of pecking order where the most important people hold all their meetings behind the curtain, or they have private dinners. then, i think, there are examples of things being agreed at davos that actually matter.\n",
            "cg: last year was quite a good case in point, because when the economic crisis was at its height, many leaders – apart from the americans – came to davos with entirely contradictory things that they should do. we came away quite depressed, thinking that there was no way the world would get its act together if this was the level of debate.\n",
            "but maybe because davos is so exposed, and was seen to be such a mess, it meant that they realised they had to do something, so by march, the g20 at least had a consistent voice, if not necessarily consistent policies. that was 6-8 weeks after davos, which shows these sorts of talking shops can be very useful.\n",
            "gt: the thing about davos is that simply getting people together in a confined space can be useful in forcing people to thrash out ideas. what is particularly notable is that it is this interface between the public and private sector, between the east and the west, that you don’t find at that many other forums. one thing that is clear about the coming year is that tackling the problems that the world now faces will require that interface – or both of those interfaces – in a way that we haven’t seen for quite a long time.\n",

            " after a two-year slowdown in mergers and acquisitions in the industry, companies are once again looking for ways to use their checkbooks to expand their reserves, buy new technology or snap up promising oil and gas fields, the new york times’s jad mouawad reports. \n",
            " unlike the round of mergers that created today’s behemoths in the late 1990s, the current round is not expected to form new giant companies like exxon mobil or conocophillips. this time, companies are focused on buying fast-growing small companies, or on acquisitions that expand their reserves in an era when it is hard for them to find new places to drill. \n",
            " the targets include companies that own new fields in nations like ghana and sierra leone, independent gas producers in the united states, and companies that control fields in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico. \n",
            " “in this industry, where you’re in the business of increasing your reserves, there are two ways to do so — to drill or to acquire,” said christopher w. sheehan, director for mergers and acquisitions research at ihs herold. “there is an intense competition for access to resources through mergers.” \n",
            " this latest wave of consolidation comes with new enthusiasm for natural gas production, especially in the united states, where new technology has significantly expanded the nation’s reserves. the huge potential of new gas fields has driven most mergers in the north american energy sector in recent months, with more to come this year, according to bankers and analysts. \n",
            " buying interest is particularly strong among the international oil majors, which had sold off many of their onshore assets in the united states over the last decade and are now eager to come back. anthony b. hayward, the chief executive of bp, said last month at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, that the gas being extracted from beds of shale was “a complete game-changer. it probably transforms the u.s. energy outlook for the next 100 years.” \n",
            " the biggest deal in that sector was announced in december, when exxon mobil said it would buy xto energy for $31 billion. shortly after, total of france said it would pay $800 million for a minority share in chesapeake energy’s barnett shale gas portfolio. chesapeake has raised about $11 billion from joint ventures for its shale gas assets in the last two years; bp and royal dutch shell have struck similar agreements in recent months. \n",
            " in a humorous note to investors, bernstein research analysts quipped recently: “frankly, you can virtually plan your gym sessions around these deals, they are becoming so regular. thinking about it, isn’t it about time for another statoil deal?” \n",
            " statoil, the norwegian national oil company, recently struck a deal with conocophillips to trade some of its assets in the gulf of mexico for acreage that conoco holds in the chukchi sea of alaska; in november, statoil agreed to pay $3.4 billion for a 32.5 percent stake in chesapeake’s assets in the marcellus shale formation in the appalachian region. \n",
            " “the growth opportunities from shale gas are something we haven’t seen in the united states for decades,” said roger d. read, managing director and senior energy analyst at natixis bleichroeder in houston. “the united states, which had been a static market, now has the chance to grow its production.” \n",
            " bankers and energy consultants expect deals to pick up this year after a two-year lull. there were 244 deals in the global oil and gas industry last year, down from 285 in 2008, and 336 at the peak in 2007, according to data from ihs herold, a consulting and advisory firm. \n",
            " while the number of transactions was down, the size of the exxon-xto transaction helped raise the total value of last year’s mergers to $144 billion, up from $104 billion in 2008. (merger values peaked at $200 billion in 1998, a year when many of today’s giant companies were created.) \n",
            " analysts point to a wide range of companies that are potentially on the market, including eog resources, southwestern energy, petrohawk energy, the encana corporation, chesapeake energy, devon energy and anadarko petroleum. \n",
            " “there will be a shakeout there. it will be eat, or be eaten,” said james bogues, who leads accenture’s north america energy mergers and acquisition unit. “given exxon’s reputation as a very deliberate, cautious company, the fact they made such a bold move with xto will no doubt inspire others that a price has been set for shale gas assets and technology.” \n",
            " outside of the united states, the pace of mergers has also picked up. suncor energy of canada bought petro-canada in a deal valued at $18 billion at the time to form a national giant and stave off possible bids from foreign buyers, particularly chinese companies. in west africa, exxon has offered $4 billion for a stake in an offshore field in ghana, though that deal could fall through given the government’s threat to block the transaction; international firms, including eni of italy, are battling over some prospective fields in uganda. \n",
            " chinese companies have also been particularly active. in august, sinopec, one of china’s biggest oil companies, closed a $9 billion acquisition, buying addax petroleum, a geneva-based oil explorer that is most active in nigeria, gabon and the kurdistan region of iraq. \n",

            "ten years ago, when asia was in the midst of its home-grown financial crisis, capitalism as practised in that continent was everybody’s favourite punchbag. though it was hard to generalise about economies ranging from indonesia to japan and from singapore to china, many academics formed general principles about where asia had gone wrong.\n",
            "asian economies were said to be too dependent on foreign capital flows and too keen on funnelling state resources through tightly controlled banks instead of relying on more creative and efficient capital markets. many practised a form of “crony capitalism” in which the interests of the state and favoured businesses, often family-controlled, were too intertwined. managers were shielded from shareholders instead of being prodded to make efficiencies and align their interests with those of their investors. governments, in general, took too close an interest in economic decision-making, misallocating capital and hindering the creative forces of the market.\n",
            "now the boot is on the other foot, find asian policymakers, regulators, bus­inessmen and politicians – some of whom had resented the lectures and some of whom had taken them to heart. not a few are starting to lecture the west about its casino capitalism and its credit-fuelled, asset-bubble growth model.\n",
            "adding to that sense of superiority is the fact that asian governments – notably those of china and japan – are the biggest holders of us treasury securities and fannie mae and freddie mac paper. having in effect bankrolled america’s disastrous spending binge, they want the satisfaction of being able to tell the west where it went wrong.\n",
            "wen jiabao, china’s premier, told a less-than-ebullient audience in davos – once a mecca to the ideas of untrammelled capitalism – about the west’s “unsustainable model of development characterised by prolonged low savings and high consumption”. he pilloried western banks, chunks of whose near-worthless stock are now owned by chinese state institutions, for their “blind pursuit of profit and lack of discipline”.\n",
            "in similar vein, prakash javadekar, senior spokesman for india’s hindu nationalist opposition bharatiya janata party, describes american capitalism as “nothing but overindulgence”. eisuke sakakibara, a former japanese finance minister, predicts that the world will never return to the consumption patterns that led to the credit collapse. “after this recession is over, things will be very different,” he warns. “the american age is over.”\n",
            "kishore mahbubani, dean of singapore’s lee kuan yew school of public policy, has been a prophet of that decline. he says asians have learnt many of the virtues of western capitalism, including its general trust of free markets. but after suffering through the asian crisis and the lectures of the international monetary fund – some of whose strictures are now being ignored by western governments – he says asians have added some lessons of their own. these include: “do not liberalise the financial sector too quickly, borrow in moderation, save in earnest, take care of the real economy, invest in productivity, focus on education.” contrasting asia’s performance of the past 10 years with that of much of the west, he says: “while america was busy creating a financial house of cards, asians focused on their real economies.”\n",
            "indeed, asians have some things right. their banks were, with some exceptions, not permitted to indulge in the foolhardy practices that have led so many western institutions to the brink of bankruptcy. individuals, companies and some governments have continued their propensity to save. executives – with the exception of some family tycoons who use their companies as piggy banks – have generally eschewed the sort of remuneration packages that have become so discredited in the west. \n",
            "yet these alleged strengths often carry as many drawbacks as advantages. high savings rates, which owe as much to poor welfare systems as to noble qualities of sobriety, have throttled domestic demand. for every successful management team untroubled by activist shareholders there has been another running its company into the ground. even putting such quibbles aside, a number of fundamental difficulties exist in what might loosely be called asian-style capitalism.\n",
            "first, the region depends on the western hyper-demand for which it now exhibits so much disdain. for much of last year, the idea persisted that asia could escape the financial crisis. asia, as mr mahbubani says, was concentrating on the real economy, busily making consumer electronics, machine tools and container ships. however, it was westerners who were buying them. \n",
            "japan is a case in point. this year, it is expected to perform worst among the group of seven industrial nations, its output shrinking by as much as 6 per cent. the sharpest contraction since the second world war has arisen even though its banks bought little toxic paper and the country ran big trade and current account surpluses. as peter tasker of dresdner kleinwort in tokyo says: “it seems so unfair.”\n",
            "second, it takes a very short memory to conclude, as some are now doing, that governments are better allocators of capital than the private sector. japan proved equally prone to creating asset bubbles as the us, even though its banking system was under much closer state guidance. in china, too, the clumsiness of the state is evident. last year, beijing grew worried that the economy was overheating and acted to cool things down. the result was a collapse in property prices and a shock to consumer sentiment, which hit economic performance even before the ef­fect of falling exports was felt. “they thought they were fine-tuning,” says arthur kroeber at dragonomics, a research firm in china. “so regulation doesn’t work, just like deregulation doesn’t work. china remains a 19th-century boom-and-bust economy.”\n",
            "finally, some asian economies, such as india, may escape the worst simply because they are poor countries still not fully integrated into the global economy. india’s restrictions on foreign investment and protection of the domestic financial industry have probably done as much harm as good. when it comes to the energy sector and to the distorting effect of state subsidies, india could have done with more deregulation, not less of it.\n",
            "likewise, china, even now, has not ditched ambitions to make its financial industry more sophisticated. fang xinghai, director general of financial services at shanghai municipality, says china may even speed up financial re­form now it is more aware of the potential pitfalls. stephen roach, chairman of morgan stanley asia, says china has prospered to the extent that it has emulated us practices, not avoided them: “the stunning record of chinese economic development is an explicit endorsement of capitalism – a development model that hinges critically on the ownership transition from state-owned enterprises to privately held companies.”\n",
            "amid the crisis – as washington adopts command-economy style nationalisations, directed lending and state bail-outs – it might be tempting to conclude that the us is edging towards a more chinese style of capitalism. but in the long run, however discredited western capitalism now appears, the movement is far more likely to be in the opposite direction.\n",
            "europe: actions seldom both collective and effective\n",
            "this could have been europe’s moment. an economic crisis caused by unfettered us capitalism should have shown the value of things the continent does best: harnessing free markets, laying down rules and running generous welfare systems.\n",
            "the point was not lost on europe’s political class. as the crisis gathered terrifying speed last september, nicolas sarkozy, french president, declared that “laisser faire capitalism is over” and heralded the return of the interventionist state. across the rhine, peer steinbrück, german finance minister, had a few months earlier confidently informed interviewers that europe’s biggest economy would escape largely unscathed – though he added that “if the sky falls in, we are all dead”.\n",
            "that caveat was to prove wise. the economic sky has indeed fallen in, delivering european capitalism a nightmare as horrible as that being experienced across the atlantic. germany’s economy is contracting faster than those of the uk or us. past top performers, such as spain, look stuck in protracted recessions. across the continent there is mood of despondency. for many the best hope is of a reasonably swift us recovery that, once again, lifts growth across the world.\n",
            "as a result, the european approach to capitalism, which seeks to combine free markets with social solidarity and regulation, faces its biggest trial since the second world war. the test will be whether, having devoted much of the past decade to attempting reform, the continent can prevent any slipping backwards and generate the internal dynamism needed to power growth in a modern industrialised economy.\n",
            "to europe’s critics the answer is relatively clear. while in the decades after 1945, its economies performed strongly in their drive to catch up with the us, they have since failed to generate sufficient self-sustaining growth. social safety nets might help soften the effects of a downturn but do not change underlying weaknesses.\n",
            "“is anybody saying that there has been some increase in the dynamism or innovativeness of these economies?” edmund phelps, nobel prize-winning economics professor at columbia university in new york, asks pointedly. “the us has better chances of pulling out of this slump in the next few years than do the countries of continental europe, because of its greater dynamism.”\n",
            "europe never had a single economic model. instead, the continent offers a variety of approaches, ranging from the pro-market and lightly regulated british and irish economies to the more protective instincts of mediterranean and the nordic tradition of blending the better elements of several models. but since the launch a decade ago of a monetary union that, except for the uk, includes the continent’s biggest economies, the models have converged. financial integration and globalisation have encouraged a drive towards liberalising markets. \n",
            "the lessons of recent history also show that crises can spur advance. the euro was born out of the foreign exchange turmoil of the early 1990s. on a different level, but equally telling, the banking crisis that hit nordic countries at the same time created the conditions for finland’s nokia, then a conglomerate, to focus on mobile telephony – a move that turned it into a global champion. jorma ollila, then chief executive, later recalled how the deep recession “forced us to restructure for the new economy much earlier than other european countries. we had to be radical.”\n",
            "could the current crisis pave the way for a similar european revival? it is not yet clear that europe as a whole has found a better way of operating than other parts of the world. even prior to the crisis, extensive welfare was often associated with sluggish growth and stubbornly high unemployment. at the level of european union-wide economic management, meanwhile, the jury is still out as to whether the current arrangements are up to the challenge. eu rules on public finance limit governments’ room for manoeuvre; monetary operations are clearly separated from fiscal policy, posing a further handicap should the crisis deepen.\n",
            "“we had a system that was built for good weather, not storms,” says jean pisani-ferry, director of the bruegel think-tank in brussels. values that appeared virtues – predictability, decentralisation and a focus on crisis prevention – have rapidly lost their allure. “in a crisis you need the exact opposite – a lot of centralisation and a lot of discretion in policymaking.”\n",
            "paul de grauwe, professor of economics at belgium’s leuven university, warns that the 27 eu countries lack ways of boosting their overall firepower by acting collectively. “if the whole thing gets out of hand in the sense of leading to depression and mass unemployment, then the whole structure is at risk. i can see politicians in some countries saying, ‘this is a lousy system, let’s change it’.”\n",
            "but the pressures of crisis management need not undo completely the reforms of recent years. until 18 months ago, europe’s biggest countries ap­peared to be benefiting from financial integration and the disciplines imposed by capital markets on governments and businesses. germany, for instance, had turned decisively away from its “rhineland capitalism” model , in which business strategies were driven collectively by managers, local politicians, bankers and trade unions. extensive restructuring had boosted international competitiveness, creating powerful export industries.\n",
            "such trends will not now be thrown into reverse, says dirk schumacher of goldman sachs in frankfurt. “unless the government takes a large number of stakes in industrial companies – which is unlikely – we are not going to see a return to the old deutsch­land ag. investors and capital markets will still have the biggest say over how corporate germany is run.”\n",
            "handicaps remain. lamed european banks and capital markets will no longer provide an impetus to economic growth – in fact, they may find themselves facing significantly tougher regulation. trust in the financial system was never high among continental europe’s politicians, especially in powerful left-of-centre parties.\n",
            "small innovative business is also unlikely to lead any revival of european capitalism. “if you ask students in this country what their dream is to be when they are 40 or 50, they don’t dream of becoming independent entrepreneurs,” says sixten korkman of finland’s etla research institute. “they are not as bad as perhaps in france, where everyone wants to be a civil servant, but you would like to see more of the kind of venture capitalism, of entrepreneurship that you have typically in the us – much more than in any country in europe.”\n",
            "but he argues the nordic economies’ social welfare systems could offer lessons to the rest of the world on how to reduce worker anxiety at a time of crisis and rapid change and on enabling economies as a whole to restructure. for health insurance and pensions, “if you rely on individual or company solutions, it is not only socially undesirable but it is also bad for business. it is more efficient to have a broader basis.”\n",
            "finland’s push into new technologies was helped also by strong links forged between academics, business and government funding. so all is not lost for europe’s economic model. still, as mr korkman accepts: “nokia is rather unique. we would need a few more.”\n",

            "quentin peel, moderator: a year ago, we talked about the credit crunch triggering a global economic slowdown; well that has certainly happened. most economists believe 2009 will be worse. the only question is whether this global economic crisis will be a severe recession or tip into outright depression. \n",
            "the one bright spot is that we’ve got a new us president, barack obama, who has come to office with extraordinary international enthusiasm. but the economic crisis will be his priority. how do we expect him to manage? are we doomed to be disappointed? \n",
            "the danger is that everyone is using national economic tools to deal with very much a global crisis – so could we slip back into a world of protectionism and national subsidies? last year we talked about the possibility of decoupling, that china and the emerging markets might escape the worst of the world recession, but that looks like a mirage now. will anyone escape? \n",
            "so, is it all doom and gloom in davos? \n",
            "economic crisis \n",
            "qp: lionel, you’ve been a regular participant over the years, do you expect to get any answers to the questions we’re asking?\n",
            "lionel barber: it will be a very different atmosphere compared with previous years. i think it will be grim. the economic picture will be very dark and sombre. and questions to watch out for are: one, are we seeing perhaps some sign that people, nations are willing to co-operate? and, two, can there be any chance of a flicker of a recovery by the end of 2009?\n",
            "qp: let’s turn to chris, because really everybody is focused – a bit, i fear, like rabbits in the headlights – on where the world economy is going. how would you predict the next 12 months for the global economy?\n",
            "chris giles: the first six months is quite easy. i think your analogy of a rabbit in the headlights is really quite apt. we don’t know what is just about to hit us, but we know it’s not going to be very good. it is going to hit the real economy hard, unemployment is going to rise across the advanced economies. we are pretty certain that in 2009 we will see the first recession in the advanced economies as a whole. output will be contracting for the first time since 1945. it is also going to spread to emerging markets; that is very clear. there is no question that the financial market crisis has spread around the world. \n",
            "the only real question is whether the world can find a way to ensure that we get a recovery in the second half or towards the end of the year. companies are not spending money, partly because they can’t get credit, but also because there is no confidence. \n",
            "if you can turn those two things round and get companies to think about investing later on in the year, then you might see the “green shoots of recovery”, but it is by no means certain. so, we could either have a bad year – or a very bad year. those are the two options at the moment.\n",
            "qp: what about the fears over these huge stimulus packages? mr obama has his, the uk has one, germany has come out with its own. is there a danger that we are just pouring taxpayers’ money down a black hole?\n",
            "cg: there is, of course, that danger. we don’t know how the stimulus packages will work. there is a respected view in normal times that \n",
            "if you throw taxpayers’ money at problems, people will expect taxes to rise in the future and they will save the money and, in a sense, things won’t work. \n",
            "at the moment, however, by far the majority of economists think that stimulus packages are worth trying. no one thinks it’s going to be a panacea or is the way to encourage long-term growth, but as a sticking plaster, where you have a particularly acute recession coming from a financial crisis, if governments are the only parties in the economy that can borrow and can actually raise capital, then it makes sense for them to do so in quite large measure. we have to remember that the only country we’re talking about that has a very large fiscal stimulus is the us; in europe, these are relatively small. \n",
            "we are going to see borrowing rising very fast in europe, but it is 1-1.5 per cent of national income; in the us it might be up to 5 per cent or even higher. it is almost certainly worth doing because, if you don’t, the outcomes are almost certainly worse than if you do. and if we do see a recovery, you can stop that spending and reverse the tax cuts relatively quickly, so long as they are reasonably well designed. \n",
            "qp: gillian, it is the markets where the problems have been. are they seeing the global economy recovering in the foreseeable future? and, perhaps more immediately, do you think the markets are actually going to be prepared to finance this big government borrowing that is coming round the corner? \n",
            "gillian tett: well, the crisis started in the credit markets – credit derivatives were arguably the very first asset class that reacted to the growing stresses and the bursting of the bubble but they have since spread to affect numerous asset classes, be it equities, corporate bonds and now, of course, government bonds. the unfortunate reality is that investors are starting to become concerned about the scale of fiscal stimulus packages and the future debt burdens that they will create. thus far, we have seen them continuing to buy bonds as a flight to safety. \n",
            "however, we have seen an extraordinary upsurge in volatility in so many other corners of the market in the past couple of years that it is entirely possible that we are going to see violent movements in government bond prices, and in foreign exchange markets too.\n",
            "qp: but do you think that we are actually going to see a series of possible national defaults, of continuing national crises as governments are unable to service their debts?\n",
            "gt: at the moment what we are seeing is uncertainty, and almost every institution which had seemed almost impregnable two years ago and in which people had put their faith, has come under attack in the markets. there is a loss of faith across the board which, as i said before, makes for a very volatile environment.\n",
            "in the short term, the question is: how do we get out of this mess? and, as chris has pointed out, governments are implementing extraordinary fiscal measures which may or may not work. in the medium term, the question is how do we remove all these extraordinary measures that governments have introduced, which are distorting how markets operate and how the financial system as a whole actually functions? and actually discovering an exit strategy, unpicking these extraordinary policy measures, is going to be very hard in the future as well.\n",
            "lb: and this could be, of course, a test for the eurozone. we’ve already seenspreads showing a clear differentiation between germany, as a kind of best in class, and portugal, italy, greece and spain at the bottom.\n",
            "gt: two years ago there was almost no one who actually tracked, say, the credit default swaps prices of portugal or italy; that really was a geek’s game. suddenly it has become a critical policy issue because the markets are signalling extreme cynicism about whether the eurozone can carry on functioning like this indefinitely.\n",
            "cg: we should be looking this year at the quantities, not the prices, because even if you look at greek sovereign bond yield on their sovereign debt, it hasn’t risen that much. it is only germany that has fallen and greece hasn’t fallen with it. greece can still borrow quite cheaply if it chooses, so it is the quantities. when it has to go to market this year, along with the other countries, will it find investors willing to do it? or will they be saying: “actually i prefer to take a lower return than go with some bunds?” \n",
            "gt: so much of the current battle is not just about the tangible numbers, it is about psychology and sentiment, and that is very fluid and potentially quite fragile in many sectors. \n",
            "banking, global economy \n",
            "qp: i want to turn to peter. i’m afraid it’s the people you talk to who are not very popular in the world today. everybody is blaming the bankers for getting us into this mess and, possibly, we have seen the death of the investment bank as we knew it. is it a transformed world you are covering? \n",
            "peter thal larsen: it will be interesting in davos to see who actually shows up. i think we will be able to do quite an interesting roll-call of all those people who no longer have their jobs, and also people who still have their jobs but are a bit too busy elsewhere. \n",
            "clearly, the bankers have a terrible reputation and have a lot of challenges on their hands. part of the issue is how we get out of the mess that the banks are in, which is affecting the rest of the economy. \n",
            "there was a feeling back in october, when we saw these bail-outs across the world, that the heart attack had been halted and the patient had been shocked back to life. but clearly it hasn’t been enough. there is a massive shortage of lending in the economy. so, we can expect to see more actions to stem the crisis before we really get out the other side. and people will then have to start discussing what the business model for banking is in the future.\n",
            "qp: that will be a very interesting debate for davos to start even now.\n",
            "ptl: i think it is a debate that is ongoing, but part of the problem is that the ground keeps shifting under them. people need to have some sense of what the world looks like, what their revenue base looks like, what is possible and what isn’t possible in the markets before they can start really reshaping their businesses. \n",
            "qp: we’ve already seen the likes of goldman sachs and morgan stanley applying to become deposit takers in order to attract the kind of funds to allow them to carry on, in effect.\n",
            "ptl: they have, and that was obviously an extreme emergency measure. the questions that neither of those institutions has really answered are: how they make a decent return on the capital they employ in the future; where the revenues are going to come from; how they are actually going to compensate their people; whether they are going to be able to keep this high-octane “hire the best, work them hard and pay them lots of money” model; and what they do in a world where, forced by the markets but particularly forced by the regulators, they will have to operate with less leverage? all these issues still have to be resolved.\n",
            "gt: we’re seeing all the concepts and trends that were fashionable at the start of the decade basically being blown to pieces. we started this decade with the idea that financial supermarkets were where the future would lead, that deregulation, free market, innovative, creative sectors like derivatives were the future, and that leverage was the name of the game; it was the only way to boost your returns to an acceptable level. \n",
            "and now each of those concepts is completely out of fashion and they are having to remake the idea of what finance is really about.\n",
            "qp:what about the return of the state bank? \n",
            "ptl:we’ve seen that taxpayers are the guarantors of the financial system, more explicitly in some cases than in others. and i think that a continuing feature of the future of banking will be a more explicit role for the state, either as a shareholder, a guarantor of certain assets, or as a guarantor of certain instruments or debts.\n",
            "qp: or as the body that insists that the banks should actually be more generous with their credit?\n",
            "ptl:that is something that most governments are still trying to resist. most governments still don’t want to actually to be selecting who should have loans and who shouldn’t, and picking winners along those lines. \n",
            "but it is quite conceivable that we could get to that point. even when this crisis really unfolded last year, there was a feeling that these bail-outs would be temporary and that the banks would be returned to the private sector in the not-too-distant future. but the level of state support is so extreme and so large at the moment that it is really hard to imagine these banks operating on a quasi-independent basis any time in the near future.\n",
            "cg:this is the crux of the financial and the economic crisis at the moment: for the banks to become more healthy, shrinking balance sheets is exactly the right thing to do. either credit growth is falling or credit itself is falling, and that is what is really scaring central bankers around the world. viable businesses cannot find funding at the moment, so the recession is getting much, much deeper than it needs to be.\n",
            "gt: one of the things that got japan out of its banking crisis in the late 1990s and the early part of this decade was that china unexpectedly boomed and created a market for japanese exports. the big question now is where is any growth going to come from in this new interconnected world, where the economic impact of what is happening to western banks appears to have seeped through the entire political and economic fabric?\n",
            "cg:it is very clear what the source of demand should be: it should be the countries that haven’t been on a borrowing spree in the last decade and have very large surpluses that can be spent. so, we’re talking oil importers – though less so now that oil prices have fallen – china, germany and even japan, where their current accounts, their trade surpluses are very large. that is where the scope for demand growth is greatest, but equally the likelihood of demand growth is probably smallest. \n",
            "this is why you’re having to see such extreme measures in other countries, like the us, trying to put a sticking plaster over the fact that their private sector demand is falling so the public sector is taking up the slack, whereas the best thing to do would be for the rest of the world to take up the slack.\n",
            "qp:we need this massive global rebalancing from this enormous us deficit and the enormous chinese surplus to get it back into balance. but actually it’s almost as if the opposite is happening.\n",
            "lb: we need to see how the us economy responds to this giant stimulus which the obama administration is preparing. and we need to see whether the extraordinary measures taken by the federal reserve to inject liquidity into the system have an effect. the us economy is a very resilient one but the depth of destruction and mayhem in its property market is such that it really will take an awful lot of time to get out of this mess. \n",
            "the other reason for cautious pessimism is that while china is clearly an important actor, it doesn’t compare in any way to the importance, say, of the us economy or even germany. so, we’ve really got to look at the eurozone and the us as the source for demand, the kind of pull-back which gillian was referring to earlier.\n",
            "china, emerging markets qp:let me turn to gideon now. we’ve been seeing a pretty dramatic slowdown in china – from 12 per cent to as low as 5 per cent this year – and this could cause big political strains there.\n",
            "gideon rachman: one of the big tensions that all the leaders at davos will be grappling with is that, on the one hand this is a global economic crisis that requires international co-operation and co-ordination, while on the other they are suddenly under enormous domestic political pressure which points them in the other direction. \n",
            "china, as you pointed out, is a good example. the chinese government is very worried by the layoffs in the manufacturing heartlands, and there has been social unrest connected with that. one of the pressures they will be under from the us is to let their currency appreciate to try to balance out the global economy. but the last thing they actually want to do is to put any more pressure on their export industry. \n",
            "and the same thing will happen to mr obama. he is instinctively an internationalist, but domestically he is under enormous pressure to do things that basically are protectionist. and it is the playing out of those tensions that is going to be really critical.\n",
            "qp: this is fascinating because here we have a global economic crisis, which everybody is trying to deal with using national economic tools. take the g20: they are going to have a summit in london in april, but this is an organisation that has never really had much substance before. the great advantage is it brings the chinese, the indians, the brazilians to the table with the g7, but other countries as well. where is the right place to solve this problem?\n",
            "gr: the big gap in the system is that you have a global economic system but the institutions of global governance are very, very weak, and actually liable to get weaker under the kind of domestic pressures that i mentioned. \n",
            "so, i think the g20 is an interesting example. at the first summit in washington in november, they signed a declaration condemning protectionism and pledging to complete the doha round of world trade negotiations by the end of the year. within a week, india and russia had passed new tariffs, and the doha round is still not completed. so, these leaders will meet in all sorts of forums, they will issue statements – they may even mean them at the time – but whether they will be able to deliver, i slightly doubt it.\n",
            "qp: this is the sort of thing davos should be thinking about as well, shouldn’t it? \n",
            "lb: it is a subject tailor-made for davos. one thing to watch is that premier wen jiabao of china will be in davos and it will be important to listen to how optimistic he is about the chinese economy in 2009, and whether he just puts tremendous emphasis on exports and how there must be no protectionism. because, of course, if there isn’t the demand in countries like the us, there won’t be room for chinese exports. \n",
            "qp: and europe, too. europe, after all, is china’s biggest market. and yet at the end of the year we saw, at very short notice, china cancelling a summit with the european union. \n",
            "gr: i think maybe the chinese cancelled the summit with the eu because it didn’t really matter. i don’t think they will cancel their first summit with mr obama, no matter how irritated they may be feeling with him. that is the critical relationship now: china as the emerging superpower. \n",
            "but for the moment, the us is preoccupied with other foreign policy issues – wars in afghanistan, iraq, and so on – but the economy has an overwhelming international aspect, and it’s the china-us economic relationship which is at the heart of it. so, he’s going to have to concentrate on it. \n",
            "lb: if you look over the past few years, the us has lectured the rest of the world on the need for democracy and the need to promote – for want of a better term – market capitalism, yet we have that seen the effort to impose democracy in the middle east has come at tremendous cost. so, the doctrine of armed intervention to promote democracy is a big question mark. \n",
            "as for market capitalism, in countries like china, it got out of hand. we need a third way, if you like. \n",
            "qp: i wanted to ask you, gillian, if the markets are looking for where to make money in this climate, is it going to be the emerging markets, or are they going to get hit even worse than everybody else? one big emerging market that seems to be in real trouble is russia, but certainly many others, too. how does it look from your perspective?\n",
            "gt: one good thing about the current situation is that the commodities bubble has burst in many parts of the market, and the emerging markets are no longer perceived as the salvation at all. on the contrary, there have been some extreme brutal shocks, as you say, in places like russia, and i think there is probably a new mood of realism about the degree to which we can expect to have decoupling reforms and development of those markets.\n",
            "ptl:we need to be careful about decoupling in general and just dismissing it entirely, because we’re seeing two sorts of simultaneous recessions at the moment. \n",
            "we are seeing the global recession in industrial production, in stock building and in corporate investment. then there’s a separate recession in the anglo-saxon countries plus spain and ireland, where they have had private sectors, particularly the household sectors, that have had much higher debts than we now think is sustainable. \n",
            "so we have to be slightly careful about just saying, “decoupling is a load of old nonsense, why did we ever believe that?” we believed it because if we thought it was going to be a household-driven recession, then that element of it is unlikely to hit germany, for example, as hard as it’s going to hit the uk or the us. \n",
            "but there is also what’s happening in the corporate sector, which is hitting everyone, and that is genuinely global, and that’s where the action has to be first of all to try and stop it from becoming a vicious spiral downwards.\n",
            "gt: if you want a reason to feel cheerful in this sea of extreme gloom and doubt, one consequence of hope being dashed in the emerging market sector is that there is a tremendous firepower of cash that could be invested if people ever did start to feel more optimistic. so, maybe that’s one little chink of light if sentiment does turn.\n",
            "the end of davos? \n",
            "qp: are we going to see quite a lot of schadenfreude at davos, or is there going to be more a mood of we are all in this together? are people going to say that this is the end of us-style capitalism, or indeed that this is the end of davos? \n",
            "gr: one of the interesting things about davos was the extent to which it brought together world leaders who had big political differences but had a common project because they all embraced globalisation. they all bought into the idea that after the fall of communism there wasn’t really an alternative to more trade, more investment. \n",
            "now, if that system appears to have gone into reverse and to actually be spreading global economic disaster rather than global economic prosperity, is that consensus going to fracture? and will that, therefore, lead to political differences that were suppressed in the age of globalisation re-emerging? \n",
            "but on your point of schadenfreude, actually i think it will be rather the opposite. there was hostility to the us at davos and elsewhere around the time of the iraq war. i think now that mr obama is in, there will be hope that, given the crisis, and given the new president, we can bury those differences. \n",
            "lb: they’ve just transferred it from washington to wall street. you will see a lot of hand-wringing and i expect to see a few metaphorical bankers strung up on the ski slopes. \n",
            "ptl: just to come back to your point about the emerging markets and decoupling, one of the factors here that nobody quite has a handle on is the extent to which the banking system is going to be forced to retrench to within national or at least regional borders. \n",
            "banks that have been nationalised, or partially nationalised, are under tremendous pressure to deleverage but they are particularly under pressure to maintain some kind of business in their home country, and that means that you see large institutions pulling out of some parts of the world. for the emerging markets, which have seen a lot of credit flowing from the big institutions, that will be a big tension.\n",
            "gt: gideon and peter make a very good point, which is that globalisation, innovation, free-market capitalism were the themes that really dominated the beginning of the 21st century. those have been the key themes of davos and the financial world, and all now are under question in ways that have implications, not just for davos and the financial sector, but also for how we run our political economy. \n",
            "qp: what about the russians? they were looking so good about nine months ago and now we’ve had the collapse of the russian stock market, the war in georgia and the economy is starting to look much more wobbly. and then we’ve started this year with this gas problem between russia and ukraine, and half of the eu getting very cold. gideon, what do you think about where the russians stand?\n",
            "gr: vladimir putin is giving one of the opening addresses at davos, and in the past the russians have used the event as a sort of marketing forum. but it will be very interesting to see their mood now. will we see a chastened russia, aware that these massive foreign reserves they’ve built up are dwindling very fast, that, as you say, they’ve got a lot of economic problems? or will we see a more assertive, aggressive russia in the mood that took their tanks across the georgian border? i would guess the latter because that’s what mr putin’s personality implies, but we’ll see. \n",
            "qp:at one level, the russians have got enormous energy reserves. on the other hand, they lack a coherent banking system. so they were very exposed, i suspect, to this credit crisis because they couldn’t produce the credit themselves at home. they were as exposed as anybody to the world market, weren’t they?\n",
            "cg: they were probably more exposed because it is a very energy-based economy. when oil prices are $140 a barrel, they make huge amounts of money, can run an extremely inefficient public sector and still have fiscal surpluses – they don’t have to have a proper tax system, or any of the things other countries need to have. but the moment oil prices fall to about $50 or below, they have big budget deficits, their trade position goes into deficit, they find that their economy doesn’t really do a huge amount else. this is pretty much what countries like the netherlands and the uk found 20, 30 years ago: that oil isn’t a panacea.\n",
            "qp: the other big unpleasantness that we’ve begun 2009 with, of course, has been the return of the israeli-palestinian conflict with a vengeance. i suspect this was one that mr obama was hoping wouldn’t be right at the top of his agenda but it probably is going to be. do you think there will be quite a lot of attention paid to the middle east in davos?\n",
            "gr: it mirrors the global picture where everybody says, “we must have a middle east peace process and we’ve really got to sort this out,” and they come back and you have the same discussion year after year. at davos last year, they had leading figures from the palestinian authority on the same stage as tzipi livni, the israeli foreign minister and one of the candidates for prime minister in israel’s upcoming elections, and they appeared to get on rather well. i would imagine it would be hard this year to maintain even a modicum of optimism about the situation but you will get the usual talk about crisis and opportunity, and how now is the time to move in. but it’s very hard to see anything positive emerging.\n",
            "barack obama and the us \n",
            "qp: what about the obama effect? do you think that there could actually be a positive effect? or is everybody hoping for too much?\n",
            "lb: obama is a brilliant politician but he is not a magician. he has the power of proposition, and his opinion ratings are high. i expect him to be given a fair wind, but there is a fairly sullen republican minority which will probably not be that co-operative. \n",
            "the second obama effect, of course, is abroad, and here expectations are almost off the charts. people genuinely think that obama will be more multilateralist, more co-operative, less confrontational. but here again i think expectations could be too high, and we shouldn’t underestimate the fact that he still represents the most powerful nation on earth, and he is not going to be a pussycat.\n",
            "qp: if you were in obama’s shoes and you’ve got this huge problem with the economy on the one hand but you want to show the world that you’re a new president, where can he break out of the george w. bush inheritance? \n",
            "lb: what he can do is call the state department, call hillary clinton into the oval office and say, “we’ve got this thing called the arab-israeli conflict, and we’d like you to try and solve it.” put the secretary of state up there, because that’s a degree of engagement which i think is probably desirable. he has multiple crises. you talked about the challenge at home, but he’s also pledged to push for greater military deployment, involvement in afghanistan. that’s a major, major problem.\n",
            "so, about the arab-israeli conflict, there will be constructive engagement. there won’t be the same move as you saw with george w. bush – when he entered office, he deliberately disengaged. mr obama understands he can’t do that. but he’s not going to – in my view – get personally involved early in the term. he’ll leave it to the secretary of state and special envoys.\n",
            "gr:i think it is a slight problem that mr obama has to somehow convince the world that he really is different from mr bush. everyone believes that at the moment, but in that sense it’s very awkward for him that the first issue that blows up is the middle east peace process where, for domestic political reasons, his hands are slightly tied. he’s not going to suddenly start talking to hamas, which is what the rest of the world is telling him he should do. so there will be a feeling that, well, we like your manner better, but the policies seem a bit the same. \n",
            "qp: but the other problem is that he’s going to ask europe to send more soldiers to afghanistan, isn’t he? that’s going to be a test.\n",
            "gr:it will be difficult but i think actually they will get there. they’ll find some sort of middle way which probably won’t actually solve the problem in afghanistan, but it will solve their immediate political problem of not appearing to disrespect the new us president’s number one foreign policy priority. \n",
            "lb: even closing the detention centre at guantánamo bay is actually a very thorny legal problem and a very thorny practical problem. when george w. bush said this nobody believed him. now we’re hearing the same thing from the obama camp. \n",
            "one has to be very clear that those who go to the us and are imprisoned, in what forum will they be put on trial? second, if they’re being put abroad, are other countries willing to take them and how many? \n",
            "qp:there’s something not a million miles from guantánamo bay which i think that mr obama could do very quickly, and that’s lift the sanctions on cuba. that would say: “i’m a different sort of president.” i don’t know whether he’s got the domestic political support for it, but that would be a very interesting early gesture. \n",
            "lb:it would be a break, and certainly the cuban exile community in florida is nowhere near as powerful as it was, and having just been in cuba, i can testify to the lack of resilience in the cuban economy. i think lifting the embargo would send a very powerful signal. everybody understands that mr obama is very different from mr bush, but he’s got to get the support of congress too and, surprisingly, there is still quite a lot of hostility to cuba in congress. \n",
            "climate change \n",
            "qp: there’s another very big debate that we’re supposed to be having this year, and that’s about climate change. post-kyoto settlements, supposed to be done by the end of the year in copenhagen, and that pitches europe against the us, or at least creates something of a transatlantic break. and how do you bind the chinese and the indians into this? is climate change going to go right off the agenda because of the economic crisis, or is it going to be really important this year?\n",
            "gr: it’s somewhere in between. mr obama has signalled that he does take climate change very seriously. but, on the other hand, the global economic crisis completely pushes in the other direction because it says, “look, you’re going to have to take some economic pain now while we make the transition to a lower carbon economy,” and it is very difficult to make that argument now.\n",
            "gt: climate change used to be an area where the themes of globalisation, innovation of green-market capitalism came together, and carbon-trading markets were going to solve our problem. now we’re in a world where the zeitgeist is changing, and we’re hearing rather less about carbon trading markets and clever derivative products creating a brave new world, and are back to issues like should we be asking\n",

            "gr: that’s a very interesting point. there are many aspects of this globalisation consensus, but what you saw all the time at davos was a huge faith in technology. but i wonder whether that technological optimismis, along with the market optimism, going to be diminished.\n",

            "interview with tony tan, deputy chairman and executive director of the government investment corporation of singapore at davos, january 25 \n",
            "ft: what would be helpful for us and for our readers would be if we talk a bit about the origins of the gic and your position and your view of the world, and specifically trying to put in a bit of context some of the high profile recent investments that you’ve made.\n",
            "tt: let me start by telling you a little bit about gic and then from there we will follow up with all the questions you want. gic or the government of singapore investment corporation was established in 1981, 27 years ago. it was actually set up by our former finance minister, dr goh keng swee, with the agreement of the then prime minister, mr lee kuan yew, who still continues as chairman of gic.\n",
            "and essentially dr goh’s view was that the monetary authority of singapore, which is our central bank, and is in charge of monetary policy and exchange rate management and so on, had more than enough reserves than was needed for the monetary function. and that it would serve singapore well if part of the reserves were to be hived off and to be managed by another organisation, or gic, which was set up.\n",
            "and dr goh felt that the skills required for central banking functions, which is monetary policy, exchange rate management, are quite different from the skills required for investment management. \n",
            "when gic was set up in 1981, as you probably remember, this was a time of great turmoil in the financial markets. inflation was very high, and mr volcker was at the federal reserve, interest rates in the us were at 14%, or something in that region. so the priority of the government then was simply wealth preservation. we started off managing a few billion dollars in singapore dollars from the mas and the mandate was to try and earn a rate of return which is at least equal to world inflation, which we define as the average of inflation of three major economic regions: the us, europe and japan.\n",
            "so gic has always had a very conservative policy of investments. gic is a fund management company. we don’t own the funds which we manage; the funds remain the sovereign funds of the singapore government. we manage the funds under a mandate given to us by the ministry of finance, which is the legal owner of the funds. and they pay us a fee, they specify the risk parameters under which we should manage the funds and that is quite tight, because, as i said, drawing on our origins the emphasis at gic has never been profit maximisation; it’s really been on wealth preservation. so that’s been the concern of the government. and gic has basically one client, the government of singapore.\n",
            "and in the event, of course, even with that policy gic has done reasonably well. our chairman, mr lee kuan yew, announced at our 25th anniversary dinner in 2006 that on average over the 25 years since gic was established, gic has earned a return on the average of 9.5%, in us dollar terms. that’s a nominal rate of return. when you take account of inflation the real rate of return is in the region of about 5.3%, which is generally regarded as quite satisfactory in terms of the size of the portfolio.\n",
            "today gic manages well over $100bn of funds. the normal preferred mode for investment at gic is to spread our investments widely because basically we try to minimise risk and to take relatively small stakes in a large number of companies. today we invest in over 30 countries in the world. we invest in all asset classes, equities, bonds, real estate, private equity, hedge funds, commodities. and we believe that this diversity has helped us to fulfil our mandate to the singapore government.\n",
            "the two investments which we made recently in ubs and citicorp were rather unusual because we don’t normally do very big investments like that. we normally like to keep a very low profile. however, we felt that this is a very unusual time in financial markets and a combination of events, the sub-prime crisis, repricing of credit, possibility of recession, obviously some unwise investments in mortgage securities like cdos has led to some of the banks including ubs, citicorp, merrill lynch, morgan stanley, all facing difficulties in having to raise new capital.\n",
            "we were approached in december by ubs who told us they wanted to raise money and whether we would be interested. and in january we were approached by citicorp. in both of these cases, in both citicorp and ubs, we actually already have shareholdings in the two banks at a very low level, less than half a percent each.\n",
            "we have been following the banks for many years. we know the banks manage money very well. in the case of ubs mr ospel and mr rohner. in the case of citicorp of course the new management, sir win bischoff, chairman, and vikram pandit from morgan stanley, the new ceo. so we are confident that these two banks will overcome their difficulties. we were encouraged by the fact that the managements were prepared to face the problem squarely, take very large write-downs in their exposures to cdos, thereby incurring very large losses. and to recapitalise the bank to put it on a firm footing again. and we felt that after that is done over a number of years the bank will regain its profitability and all shareholders would benefit. but of course under these circumstances, of course, we don’t know…this will not happen overnight, and we structured our investments in both ubs and citigroup in the form of convertible notes which pay us a rate of return which will convert into the respective shares in ubs and citigroup over a period of years. but that’s really the crux of all this.\n",
            "ft: i’m interested particularly in those two investments. i know a bit more about the circumstances of the ubs investment but i think both of them were done relatively quickly. how much time did you have to make yourself comfortable that the write-downs were sufficient, that there weren’t going to be more? and in the context of particularly in citigroup’s case, where they had already raised some money, i wonder what kind of protections you were seeking?\n",
            "tt: in the case of gic, our investment process is perhaps a little bit different from other companies. we always look at risk first, how much money can we lose, what is the downside. and only when we are assured that a risk is manageable and within our risk limits then we look at what is a reasonable rate of return. in the case of ubs and citigroup, actually we know the banks well. we have been following them, we had our own estimates of what we thought their exposure was. so, when ubs approached us we asked for more information and exposure and what we had to do, and it came within the limits of what we thought it would be. so, this was dealt with relatively swiftly, within a day or so, because we actually had all the background really. having decided, then, that this was a transaction which we wanted to do, we had always felt that if ubs or citigroup would like to raise money we would be interested, so when they approached us we indicated that we would be interested, and it took a few days to negotiate the size and terms of the investment.\n",
            "obviously, both ubs and citigroup were discussing with other people as well. but i think the point about both of these banks, first of all they are banks, and when a bank has to raise money it is different from other companies having to raise money. when a bank has to raise money, particularly to strengthen his capital, it has to do two things: first of all it has to raise money quickly, and it must succeed. it is not possible for a bank to announce that it will raise money and then not be able to do so; this would have a tremendously adverse impact on confidence in the bank. obviously both in the case of ubs and citigroup i’m sure any sensible management will say if i want to raise money would first of all say can i raise it from the present shareholders through a rights issue? if they felt they could do it this would be the best thing to do. we are among the present shareholders in ubs and citigroup. under those circumstances also i think a rights issue takes a lot of time and also is uncertain as to how it would be received. i’m sure the management of ubs and citigroup, after considering all the possibilities, decided they should go outside shareholders and raise the money. in this case we were happy that we were able to negotiate terms that were agreed between ubs, citigroup and us to the satisfaction of both sides.\n",
            "ft: in the case of ubs some of the shareholders don’t seem terribly happy.\n",
            "tt: well, there is always the worry about dilution, and that is a matter for the management of ubs to resolve. in the case of citigroup, of course, in addition to the private placement they also had a public placement as well. we are of the view that the terms under which we have invested in both ubs and citigroup are fair and reasonable. we are not out to actually get the maximum terms. of course we want to have reasonable return for the money which we have put in under these circumstances, and it is not a riskless asset, things can still go wrong and we have to take that into consideration, but the ubs management has kept us in touch with their discussions with shareholders and we are told that they are quite confident. i think the february 27th egm will be a rather stormy affair, but they are confident that it will be passed, because if it is not then i think the bank will have some problems. the shareholders will realise that. i think some shareholders, particularly in switzerland, are probably unhappy about the losses and why ubs has been brought to this state and needs to raise such capital; but that is a different issue.\n",
            "ft: one suggestion that seems to be doing the rounds is that ubs may make some concessions to existing shareholders in order to be absolutely certain that this resolution will pass at the egm. if they asked you would you be prepared to adjust the extent of your investment?\n",
            "tt: we would be prepared to adjust the terms. we would be prepared to see how we could help them. but we have signed an agreement with them so that has to be honoured. we have told ubs we would be prepared to work with them, obviously they have to think though the consequences. we would protect our rights. but obviously we would certainly like to see the proposal approved at the february 27th meeting. and we always believe in working with the management as a responsible shareholder. gic is essentially a long-term financial investor; we are not a trader like a hedge fund and neither are we a strategic investor where we buy into a bank for wider political purposes. we always believed and had confidence that ubs and citigroup will get over their problems and there would eventually be good returns to all the shareholders, including gic. as to how the management will manage the egm, that is their job.\n",
            "ft: i get the sense that ubs have been taken aback by the extent of the protest, and also some of the political resistance to the size of this foreign investment. has that surprised you as well?\n",
            "tt: no. i think on the political side we are very encouraged by the fact that here in switzerland the authorities, the swiss national bank and the swiss federal commission have actually come out openly to say that they support the proposal and they believe it is good for ubs. so, we have had no problems with that.\n",
            "ft: you mentioned that you are not very sure of people before you took the investment; do you expect any other management changes at senior level, either at citibank or ubs?\n",
            "tt: well, citibank has had a rather big shake up, so i’m sure that sir win bischoff and mr pandit have already said that they are going through the bank with a fine tooth comb, a dispassionate view, and presumably will make changes where necessary. similarly i believe mr ospel and mr rohner in ubs have some difficulties with the investment banking side which they have to fix. mr rohner now, in addition to being ceo of the bank, is also ceo of the investment banking division; that is probably far too much for any one person to take on. presumably they are looking to see who they can get to take over some of the responsibility; that is only sensible.\n",
            "ft: how does it work in terms of the amount of the assets that you were given to manage? are you given a fixed proportion of the reserves that are generated every year?\n",
            "tt: no. the governor of singapore, because we’ve been running budget surpluses every year, will decide each year a certain amount of money which should be transferred out of the honorary account and set aside as reserves to be managed by gic. it is entirely up to the government; there is no specific formula.\n",
            "ft: do you have any fixed liabilities? \n",
            "tt: liabilities?\n",
            "ft: to what extent are you returning capital to the government? or is it continually expanding?\n",
            "tt: we manage to fund an endowment for present and future generations of singaporeans. we generate a return every year, and at present the government takes 50% of the net income and dividends after expenses and everything, to be transferred back into their honorary revenue budget. that is spelt out in our constitution. \n",
            "ft: i see, but so, provided you don’t lose money on your investments mathematically the size of the fund will continue to expand on an annual basis.\n",
            "tt: so far it’s seemed to work quite well.\n",
            "ft: is there an upper size for a fund like this? do you think there is a point at which actually you can’t manage that much money effectively?\n",
            "tt: we haven’t reached that yet.\n",
            "ft: but just on the size, one thing i found when i started looking into this is that there is a huge variation in the range and quality of data you can find out about different funds and the amount of disclosure. i’ve seen a wide range of estimates on the gic figures, anything from 100 billion to 300 billion. that’s not something that you disclose publicly, is it?\n",
            "tt: no. i must make it clear. gic is a fund management company. the decision to decide how much to disclose actually belongs to the government not gic. we may be the agent to make disclosure on return, size of funds, but it’s actually the government as the owner of the funds which has the authority to decide what they want to disclose, and of course they’ve got other considerations. we act on instructions from the government.\n",
            "ft: could you just say a bit about your relationship, or lack of relationship with temasek?\n",
            "tt: temasek is different from gic. temasek is a holding company. it’s set up as a holding company for the investments. when we became independent in 1965 not many people held out much prospects for singapore so very few people were prepared to invest in singapore. so the government set up companies like singapore airlines, dbs bank, and so on. originally this investment was held directly by the ministry of finance in singapore.\n",
            "after a while the government decided it was more practical, actually, to form a holding company, temasek holdings, and transfer all of these shareholdings to them. so, temasek is different from gic in the sense that temasek actually owns the funds which they manage. we don’t own the funds. the only common feature with temasek and gic is that both of us are owned by the singapore government. temasek works under a mandate from the singapore government.\n",
            "with regard to relations between temasek and gic, we operate entirely separately and we are very scrupulous about it. we have no common officers, we do not discuss strategies or what to do, and we have to be very careful about this because in some cases when both temasek and gic have shareholdings in a company, it’s very important that this should be regarded as two separate entities, not two entities working in concert, so we are very, very scrupulous about that. we never invest or hold investment discussions or exchange views on news with temasek. we are very particular about that because that’s very important.\n",
            "ft: i guess it’s conceivable then that you, in a certain situation, would end up both investing in a similar companies?\n",
            "tt: i think a couple of the chinese banks, i think, we have invested in, and i think an indian bank. but we come to the decision separately.\n",
            "ft: just talk a bit about your asset allocation in your portfolio. how do the two most recent investments fit into that because, no matter what number we use for the size of your fund, they are a large part of your fund. how do you think about that from a risk management perspective?\n",
            "tt: we are very particular about that. we have an asset allocation strategy which is decided by the gic board and essentially all that they do. within that investment allocation strategy we have limits for how much we would invest in each sector. we obviously have a limit to how much we would invest in the financial sector, how much we would invest in us and in europe. we do not breach those, so the investments which we have made in ubs and in citigroup, $16bn, would come within that limit. we would not breach that limit and we are very careful about that.\n",
            "we believe that one of the reasons why we have, for example, weathered these cdo difficulties well is because we have always put risk management as a very high priority. we studied cdos on many occasions in the past several years. we could not understand who was bearing the risk there. we looked at this many times and we decided several years ago, as a policy, that we will not invest in cdos, so we have no direct exposure to cdos at all. of course, we also invest in funds and they invest in cdos, so indirectly we do have some exposure, but as far as direct exposure is concerned i think our risk management framework works quite well.\n",
            "ft: given your limits within sectors, have you liquidated any positions in other financial institutions to take advantage of this investment particularly?\n",
            "tt: let me answer that question in a very, very general way. i would say that we have been getting very concerned about the state of the financial markets for many years. we became very concerned in the first half of 2007. we thought that this leveraging could not continue and that eventually it would have repercussions on the financial markets, so around about the second quarter of 2007 we took a thorough review of our asset allocation and we made a decision to move towards a more conservative portfolio, liquidating part of our equity holdings and moving into cash which is something which we have not done for many years. the last few years we have been fully invested and that’s been very good. the last four to five years have been a golden period for investment management. everybody has been a genius. things have been doing well. but we decided that we should liquefy and raise cash which is a major decision because we have not done that for some years and we thought that this eventually will affect the market.\n",
            "so in the third quarter of 2007 we did convert part of our equity holdings into basically cash. i think that it would be true to say that we were right in the direction in which the markets would move, but what we did not expect was how quickly the markets would move and to what extent. and, as you remember, the markets started to face difficulties in around about july/august/september, but it was only in the last quarter of last year that everything fell apart within a couple of months, so this was very unusual. i can’t say that we had extraordinary foresight. but i think the point is that you make the major calls right and everything falls into place. so, when we were approached by ubs and citigroup to put in the investments we had the financial resources to do so without having to liquidate for the assets.\n",
            "ft: how would you summarise your position now as far as financial services companies are concerned, because i imagine that the number of phone calls and visits has picked up quite substantially ever since you invested in ubs and citigroup?\n",
            "tt: well, first of all, we will look at every offer that is made to us. we feel that we have a duty to do that, to see whether it’s a good investment for us, whether it fits our risk return profile. the fact that we have structured citigroup and ubs investments in the form of convertible notes, must be an indication that we expect that it would take some time before all of these issues are worked out and that there will be some bumps along the road.\n",
            "ft: in terms of your position as an investor, how do you trade off the lack of liquidity of an investment like that compared to a smaller direct equity stake with some kind of control or some kind of influence?\n",
            "tt: as i said, we would prefer to continue with our previous mode of investment, taking relatively small stakes. if we take an adverse view we can liquidate it quickly. we also knew when we took this investment in ubs and citigroup that it would attract a lot of attention, that’s why for the ubs one it was the first time that we had called a press conference to answer questions about it.\n",
            "but we also felt that if you are going to do it you have to cope with all the consequences. one of the consequences is a high level of visibility. singaporeans, the public, the financial community, would be interested in what you are doing. as i said, we are a financial investor. we do not seek control. for example, in the case of ubs, we did not make sitting on the board a condition of the investment, and subsequent to our making the investment ubs invited us to nominate a representative to sit on the board. mr ospel wrote to me to make the invitation. we have considered it seriously over the last few weeks and we have informed ubs that, under these circumstances, we believe that we should not take up the invitation. we thanked them for it, but i think that we want to be seen to be quite clear that we are not seeking control. in the case of the citigroup investment it was exactly the same. we have stated it quite clearly.\n",
            "ft: the question is if either institution were to continue to perform poorly, or you had concerns about the quality of the management at some point in the future, at that point what do you do?\n",
            "tt: first of all, as shareholders, we have a right like any shareholder to put our views to the management, which we have done not only in ubs or in citigroup, other companies in which we have shareholdings. we also manage investments in many companies in many countries. we keep a very close eye on economic events. i would say that the managements have always welcomed information, suggestions, but we’ve always made it quite clear that these are our views as shareholders, but it’s up to the management and the board of directors of ubs and citigroup to make the decisions. we can give them our views but certainly we cannot tell them what to do. they are running the bank; we are not running the bank, and i think that this has to be very clear. as to what we will do if things don’t improve, we have to see. we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. at the present time we, as i said, have confidence in the management. it’s very important when you invest in a company you’re not only investing in the institution, you’re not only investing in the business, you are also investing in the people running the company, so the reasons why we have invested in citigroup and ubs is because we know the management and we believe they have the ability to actually overcome the problems and that they will, in four or five years’ time after all of this has been cleared up, both citigroup and ubs will return back to their very high performance.\n",
            "ft: do you think opposition as a sovereign wealth fund limits your ability to be more activist in putting your views across to management because of the danger of it, rightly or wrongly, being seen as political?\n",
            "tt: we have not had that difficulty and i’ve never felt, in my discussions with management that they have given us any special consideration because we are sovereign wealth fund. if the management does that there’s probably something wrong there with the management! i think that they should give consideration to the quality of the views, does it make sense, does it give them a new insight, and this can come from anyone. but we believe also because we have had such a long history of investments and we have the ability to look at so many situations that on occasions i think that we can give valuable feedback to the management. but after we’ve given the feedback we always made it quite clear that it is their job to take the decisions. it’s not our job.\n",
            "ft: it’s an election year in the us and we’ve seen some protectionist comments as you would expect in the us political process, quite a lot of debate about developments. the dangerous part is you’re being included in a group which goes on a spectrum from norway to china, and everybody’s being lumped together. i wonder whether there is anything you feel that you can do practically to address some of these concerns?\n",
            "tt: let me first say we understand these concerns. twenty or 30 years ago when there were only a few of such funds, ourselves, abu dhabi, kuwait, nobody paid much attention to them. the term wasn’t even invented then so we were able to do our business quietly. but now many other funds are being formed, china, i’m told in russia, middle eastern countries, so i think it’s understandable that there should be some concern in europe and in america as to what the agenda of these funds are, do they have political motives, are they investing for other than commercial reasons. our view from singapore is that these concerns are quite valid and have to be addressed. last october at the imf/world bank meeting, mr paulson, the us treasury secretary, hosted a dinner where several funds and ministers of countries like singapore and kuwait and so on were present, as well as the oecd countries.\n",
            "at the dinner it was agreed that the imf and the world bank should be tasked with drawing up some code of best practices in order to address this issue. we support that; we think that such a code would be helpful in making it clear that these funds should only invest for commercial reasons, perhaps reasons of some of the doubts. \n",
            "our view, which we have given to the imf and world bank treasury, is that we believe that what is important is to work on firstly two issues: one is the purpose of the investment and the other is the governance of the fund, who it is responsible to, and that is something we should work at.\n",
            "we also felt that if the guidelines are eventually drawn up they should be general, they should be flexible, and to some extent they should be voluntary because funds are different, countries are different, and what you don’t want is to have a set of regulations which will apply to all funds. i don’t think in this case a one-size-fits-all solution would be possible; but in the process i think a lot of issues would be clarified. the other point i would bring up with regards to this request for disclosure and transparency is that i don’t think that sovereign wealth funds should be disadvantaged vis-à-vis other investors, like fund management companies, like wellington and capital, or hedge funds or private equity groups, which don’t have to disclose everything. there should be a level playing field. \n",
            "the reason why we think that this process should be done is because i think the greatest danger, and it is not addressed directly here, in continuing to be doubts then some form of financial protectionism is going to arise, and barriers will be raised to hinder the flow of funds. the attitude of different countries varies towards that: in europe, france and germany seem to be more concerned about it. britain takes a very open attitude. the prime minister, gordon brown, has been to china and says we welcome your investment. so, it depends on the national government. in the us, of course, as i said, our view is that the us administration is fully aware of this but we know they work with congress as well. the more that this is ventilated the better when we arrive at a rational solution.\n",
            "ft: and do you think in order to get a rational solution do you accept that you are going to have to make certain concessions in terms of disclosure about your fund?\n",
            "tt: we will disclose more. we have already decided that the circumstances have changed; there is more interest in swfs, there is more interest in gic, not only internationally but also within singapore. the only right thing to do would be, i think, for us is to move towards the path of more disclosure. as to what we would disclose, that remains for further discussion.\n",
            "ft: is the disclosure up to you or up to the government?\n",
            "tt: it’s up to the government. of course we would put our views to the government. it is really the ministry of finance who has the final say as to what is disclosed because they own the funds; we are just an agent.\n",
            "ft: you mentioned earlier you wouldn’t want to be put at a disadvantage; what kind of disclosures do you think would do so?\n",
            "tt: for example there has been some suggestion that we should put out a full list of all the private equity groups we have worked with and so on. we don’t really see the purpose of this, and we think that this would be something that is undesirable and would hinder the operations of gic. it is certainly not required of other investors.\n",
            "ft: i think you are taking quite a leading role in drawing up the proposals.\n",
            "tt: we have been asked, and we have responded positively because we think this is good. my own view is that there is not going to be any one perfect solution. it is something which will take shape over a period of time as there is more discussion. that is why i think it is good that there is this forum in davos. today i attended another session at lunch, there was one at breakfast and i gather there were two others, so there is quite a lot of discussion here at davos and in forums in the media. all of this is good as you need to look at it from different angles and work systematically. it is not something which is easily resolved; it is very complex. \n",
            "one of the things, for example, which will give arise to a lot of debate is what is swf. it covers such a spectrum of entities from classical swf, like gic and abu dhabi investment authority in kuwait to basically state-owned companies, which are like an swf or state pension funds. so, in itself, that will be a cause for debate.\n",
            "ft: or just foreign reserve funds.\n",
            "tt: so, you have to decide these things. the term is used very, very loosely. when you actually sit down to draft some code of practice i think you have to be more precise.\n",
            "ft: there has obviously also been a lot of debate about the projected growth in assets that there are likely to be flowing into these funds and what influence that might have in terms of the different investment approaches you take and how you end up. would you say that the investments we’ve seen in ubs and citigroup, when we look back in five years time, will still be an exception? or will we look at that and say that was the beginning of a shift which you were more willing to do high profile investments?\n",
            "tt: you are talking about gic?\n",
            "ft: gic, yes.\n",
            "tt: i would say that ubs and citigroup are unusual transactions brought about by an unusual combination of events. it would not be our preferred mode of investment, but given the circumstances and the opportunity to make these investments at a very unusual time we felt that we should depart from our preferred mode. i do not see this as a normal line of business for gic. i think that we would prefer, by and large, to continue with our present mode, relatively low profile, widely spread out investment strategy. and i think our results over the last 25 years have shown this doesn’t harm us. i presume that the ministry of finance is really satisfied with the performance; otherwise he would have sacked us long ago. he would have given our mandate to someone else. \n",
            "ft: could you give some sense of your asset allocation now and, say, a year ago, as between major investment categories and equities, fixed income, etc?\n",
            "tt: well, the majority of our investments are still in the developed countries in europe. we have increasingly, for the last few years, increased the amounts which we have invested in emerging countries. we’ve also, over the last few years, basically moved more of our investments out of public markets to what one might call private markets because we have found that this gives us a better return, and within risks which we believe we can manage. and this has been going on steadily. we don’t really make very big moves one way or the other. \n",

            "twiggy, who is building a so-called “new force in iron ore”, owns nearly 37 per cent of fmg, worth some a$7.4bn ($6.7bn) at monday’s high. that puts him ahead of the casino and media baron james packer’s a$7.25bn and the property magnate frank lowy’s a$6.5bn, according to australia’s most recent rich list.\n",
            "twiggy’s rise through the rankings is all the more remarkable given he only formed fmg in 2003. he then snapped up vast tracts of land containing iron ore in western australia’s pilbara region that was deemed unattractive at the time by heavyweights bhp billiton and rio tinto. his timing was perfect given china’s subsequent unquenchable appetite for iron ore and fmg has become an irritant to his bigger rivals that are now forced to contend with a new entrant.\n",

            "• andrew edgecliffe-johnson, media editor• chris giles, economics editor• quentin peel, international affairs editor• gideon rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator• gillian tett, global markets editor• peter thal-larsen, banking editor\n",
            "quentin peel, moderator: the world economic forum in davos is meeting this year against a background of considerable political and economic uncertainty. \n",
            "the credit crunch of 2007 seems certain to trigger an economic slowdown in 2008 – but will it be limited to the us and europe while the emerging economies led by china, india and russia pick up the slack and maintain global growth? \n",
            "politics will be dominated by the race for the us presidency but with other elections – in russia, pakistan, taiwan, spain and zimbabwe – also creating a level uncertainty. \n",
            "then, behind it all, the great media event of the year is likely to be china’s hosting of the olympic games in beijing, underlining the ever more outward-looking role of that vast nation. \n",
            "all this and we have seen an energy price spike with oil touching $100 a barrel, gold hitting $900 an ounce and commodities in general hitting new highs with real worries about the price of food and food security. the plight of the global investment banks has seen the sudden arrival of sovereign wealth funds on to the international scene, buying huge chunks of what were once mighty western institutions. clearly, we are seeing southern multinationals becoming more of a force on the global stage. \n",
            "is this a world of greater competition, greater division, greater uncertainty or, as perhaps the wef would like, greater collaboration and international co-operation? \n",
            "the credit squeeze\n",
            "qp: gillian, let’s start with you. the wef sees itself as setting the global agenda for the year and it brings together business, politics, cultural people, scientists to discuss a broad agenda. you have been covering the credit squeeze. is that going to be the dominant theme?\n",
            "gillian tett: it is certainly going to be one of the key themes. ironically, the title of this year’s gathering in davos is the “power of collaborative innovation” but the problems besetting the financial world right now, and potentially the global economy, are down to far too much financial innovation in recent years. \n",
            "the financial world has, of course, been hit by a wave of losses in the subprime mortgage sector. but the losses could go much further than subprime alone and investors are losing faith in a whole corner of global finance known as structured finance, securitisation. all of the innovation that we have seen in this sector has created severe problems that, in turn, are having knock-on implications for the banking world because structured finance has been a key driver of profits. it also has potential implications for the economy more broadly because structured finance has been a key factor driving the recent credit bubble and, as that goes into reverse, we could see a world where credit becomes much harder to come by for the global economy.\n",
            "qp: chris, you come at this from an economic perspective. how tough is it going to be? are we going to see a tightening of the global economy or do you think that the emerging economies like china and india can keep up the momentum?\n",
            "chris giles: no one knows. it is still too early and this is the big, hotly disputed question for 2008. \n",
            "if you talk to the individual banks about their own fortunes in the face of the credit crunch, they are pretty nervous. but when they get together as a collective lobby, they become probably the most optimistic group on the global economy out there. the banks certainly think that the slowdown will end in the first half of 2008 and we will be worried about inflation in the second half of the year. \n",
            "it has to be said, however, that the consensus opinion is beginning to become more pessimistic about the economy, particularly in the us for the first half of 2008. this is led by ben bernanke, chairman of the us federal reserve, who is pretty gloomy, and we can certainly expect some more interest rate cuts there. \n",
            "but that is not the only opinion. jean-claude trichet, head of the european central bank, has been very upbeat about the european economy. japan has not particularly been affected by the global credit crunch and, so far at least, we have seen absolutely no impact on emerging markets. \n",
            "some of the big questions are: how deep will the us fall into problems this year; will the rest of the advanced economies suffer alongside the us; and to what extent can emerging markets go ahead on their own? you have to remember that in 2006 and 2007, china, russia and india alone accounted for nearly half of the world’s total growth. so, it is absolutely not the case that they are just waiting for the us locomotive to arrive and they can only hop on board at the back of the train. they can, in their own right, drive the train themselves.\n",
            "qp: let’s look at the adjustment of global imbalances which we are almost certain to see. the us has been running this enormous deficit and that is going to be reduced. china has been running this enormous surplus and that is going to be reduced. in the middle, europe has actually been keeping itself roughly in balance. suddenly, if the us and china are going to adjust on either side of europe, is it going to get caught in the squeeze? will an inevitable consequence of this adjustment be a much bigger european deficit and, therefore, a squeeze on europe, too?\n",
            "cg: it would certainly help the rest of the world if europe did run a bigger deficit. this is probably just the moment, when demand might be lacking in the rest of the world, that the world needs european consumers – and perhaps governments – to spend a lot of money, more than they produce, and develop a current account deficit. \n",
            "it is also the case that if china were to spend more, it could certainly take some of the heat off the us with the consequent knock-on effects a us slowdown might have on other advanced economies. \n",
            "what we want to see is a gradual unwinding of these imbalances. this is not happening yet and if it took place gradually it would certainly limit any global downturn and make the us adjustment and the financial market adjustment easier to withstand. but we do not know whether we are going to get that or, instead, a classic credit-induced downward cycle where banks are in trouble and stop lending, causing more economic problems and pushing banks into even deeper trouble, creating a vicious downward cycle. \n",
            "geopolitics\n",
            "qp: i want to turn to politics. gideon, we have the us presidential election which, because we have all the primaries in the first half of the year, is going to leave the us in political suspense for much of the year. if we have, at the same time, the biggest threat of economic recession in the us, are we going to have a government in america that is capable of actually responding to the downturn?\n",
            "gideon rachman: the big question of the year will be us leadership in both economic and in political terms. as we have heard, there is uncertainty over the future of the american economy but, equally, i think there is a threat of the us withdrawing from the world stage. obviously not completely, but other countries will be tempted to wait out the bush presidency because he is a lame duck president. particularly on issues like climate change, where a lot of people have been very impatient with the bush administration’s approach, there will be a big temptation, despite the urgency of the question, to say: “hang on, we might have a democrat in the white house next or we might have john mccain, a republican who has taken a softer line on climate change – so why not just wait?” \n",
            "similarly, there are questions about how effective the bush administration can be in exerting global leadership on other issues. on the middle east, we are seeing a big push by the president – rather belatedly – to try to get movement on the israeli/palestinian question, but other presidents have tried that in the last year of their administration without succeeding. and then there’s the draining effects of the wars in iraq and afghanistan where the americans are looking for other countries to help them out. in iraq, they are virtually on their own and in afghanistan, most of the european states do not seem to be forthcoming with more troops. so, it is going to be a tough year for us leadership. \n",
            "qp: what about the other big presidential election of the year, in russia. dmitry medvedev, the man anointed by vladimir putin and whom everybody assumes will become the next president, was one of the stars of davos last year, delivering a well-received speech which more or less marked his arrival on the international scene. given that the result of the election is an almost foregone conclusion, do the russian elections matter? should we be worrying about the outcome?\n",
            "gr: it will still be an important event. i was at that davos dinner with medvedev last year and it was quite a moment because the russian corporate and political elite was there, too. when medvedev stood up and got this amazing ovation you could sense the confidence of a resurgent power. you will have even more of that this year, partly as a flipside of us weakness. \n",
            "putin had a very assertive year in foreign policy in 2007. shortly after davos, he gave a really tough speech in munich about the us. so, russia is expanding into the vacuum, if you like, that america is leaving. equally, it is going to be a big year for china because of the beijing olympics which will be a big symbol of rising chinese power. so, again, there is this question of the ­shifts in the global balance of power.\n",
            "qp: is davos actually rather a good moment for the engagements across these lines because you have big delegations from china and from india and so on?\n",
            "gr: yes, i think so. quite often, countries use davos as a way of making a statement. in 2006, for example, the indians expended a lot of effort to make a big splash. there were lots of sessions on “emerging india”, the country sent 80 delegates compared to 30 the year before and they sponsored a big party. \n",
            "gt: it is always interesting to look at the guest list of who is coming to davos and when i flicked through, two things immediately jumped out. first, there is a big delegation coming from the gulf, with representatives from a number of the region’s sovereign wealth funds and companies like dp world, the dubai ports operator. i am sure they will be trying to present a more cuddly, friendly face to global investors and global policymakers than is sometimes presented in the media. \n",
            "second, there is also an unusually large delegation of us financial policymakers and regulators. they will be trying to both defend the american model of finance to the rest of the world – a rather sceptical audience – and to engage with the private sector and regulators in other jurisdictions to try and hammer out some regulatory responses to the subprime crisis. \n",
            "banking, media\n",
            "qp: peter, you are going to be talking to a lot of bankers. are they going to be a humbled group who will be showing a rather stronger sense of shame than they may have done in the past? \n",
            "peter thal-larsen: yes. it has been a humbling six months for all of them, frankly, and that probably helps in terms of actually bringing the conversation back down to more normal levels from some of the hubris we have seen over the past four or five years. but, equally important, for the first time in a long time there is a real divergence and a real debate within the banking industry about the direction in which that industry is heading. on the one hand, some people are saying that the recent turmoil has been a big dislocation for the sector but fundamentally the model is the right one and it will recover. at the same time, there are others who argue that the originate/distribute model is completely broken and that the system itself needs to be replaced. \n",
            "qp: what about sovereign wealth funds and the influence of big chinese and gulf investments into the investment banking industry? will they be passive investors or will they actually try and change the strategy a bit?\n",
            "ptl: the investments so far have been quite pragmatic and made by funds which have the ability to be long-term in their outlook. this is a good moment in terms of valuation and the funds have taken big stakes in large financial institutions with the view that that they will eventually recover. \n",
            "it would become interesting if the recovery didn’t happen and you found that the government of singapore owned 10 per cent of ubs and the bank were to continue to underperform. we have seen this, for example, with citigroup. saudi arabia’s prince alaweed bin talal has been a big investor in the company since the early 1990s and has been very vocal when he thought things were not going well. that can only increase with these kinds of investments. \n",
            "qp: in the media sector, andrew, there have also been big shifts towards much more ownership by the emerging economies.\n",
            "andrew edgecliffe-johnson: absolutely. the media sector has been obsessed by the hollywood writers’ strike for the past several months, but the bigger issue for them and much of the corporate world is the investors’ strike. as peter was saying, short-term investors are giving up on large swathes of the market which creates an opportunity for long-term investors. we are now seeing sovereign wealth fund money coming in with investments in time warner and sony. there is also a lot of talk about some of the longer-term investors – the likes of rupert murdoch and haim saban – being able to place big bets at a time when others are giving up. \n",
            "in the corporate world there is a sense of opportunity in merger and acquisition terms where, for a year or two, companies have seen themselves outbid on anything that moved by the private equity sector. these corporates now feel, with private equity on the back foot, that there is the chance to buy things at reasonable valuations. the difficulty for them is access to capital. as with everybody, the access to cheap credit has dried up largely and now, with the equity markets looking more bearish, that closes off another avenue. it will be a race to the finish line to see whether their optimism can outweigh investor caution.\n",
            "gt: another of the ironies of this year’s meeting at davos is that this time last year, we were all worrying about whether private equity was going to take over the world because capital was so cheap. in fact, the private equity industry was so worried about the potential for a backlash that it commissioned a big report from josh lerner of harvard business school to try to present a case for private equity and why it is actually a jolly good thing. \n",
            "now, as andrew said, private equity is very much on the back foot. however, this report is now coming to fruition and so i think one of the debates that will be occurring on the sidelines of davos will be the role that private equity is playing today across the corporate scene.\n",
            "africa\n",
            "qp: what about the broader emerging markets? one continent which seemed to be attracting quite a lot more interest last year was africa – growth rates were picking up and so on. then suddenly, at the beginning of this year, just as people were saying, “we can still make money in africa,” the kenyan elections go wrong and there is a blow-up of violence. are people going to be saying, “oh dear, another reason for caution, another reason for pulling back?” chris, do you think this is africa going off the boil again?\n",
            "cg: it is very difficult to know exactly what will happen in africa. if you look at the broad statistics and don’t consider what happened in kenya, you would say that africa is having an amazingly good period. growth rates are strong, forecasts are strong, any african economy that is heavy on commodities or oil is doing very well. but growth is not limited to only those countries. some of the east african economies – tanzania and kenya itself – have all had very strong growth rates recently. so, if you look at the general economic indicators, you would say this is just the time for africa to emerge with 5/6/7/8 per cent growth rates across much of the continent. \n",
            "if, however, you look at the political situation, you wonder if this will last. this is the time when there will be a lot of caution because the growth rates have been, to a large extent, driven by things like the commodities boom. this boom is likely to continue but commodity-driven economies are not permanently successful. rapidly growing commodity sectors in politically unstable countries are not necessarily the recipe for long-term success.\n",
            "qp: but are we not seeing a new global race for the ownership of resources, with emerging markets, such as china and india, buying up oil companies and future oil sites? \n",
            "gr: the kenyan events will reinforce deep scepticism about the ability of africa to get its act together politically. however, things have to go really badly wrong before companies completely lose interest in places with abundant resources. if you look at nigeria, it is a political disaster area but this does not stop oil multinationals from going in there because that is where the oil is. so, things really have to go zimbabwe-style wrong before businesses give up on countries that are rich in commodities. \n",
            "the chinese, meanwhile, are going to retain a big interest in energy and other commodities in africa and that is creating a kind of competition with the us and europe for influence in africa. and it is interesting in terms of chinese foreign policy – this is really the first chinese expansion outside of asia where they have built up a big sphere of influence which isn’t in their immediate neighbourhood. \n",
            "aej: one issue is the search for growth. the corporate world is looking around in its domestic markets in the west and asking if they will provide the growth which their investors are expecting and the answer is typically no. \n",
            "in the media sector, you are increasingly finding that the likes of time warner, which currently generates less than 20 per cent of its earnings from outside the us, is having to place much bigger flags around the world. \n",
            "when you come to africa, the international companies that are in those countries have assessed the risks. they are not naïve about the uncertainty of operating in africa. in the mobile sector, for example, the growth rates on offer compared to what is possible within europe or some of the established asian markets are so attractive they cannot be ignored.\n",
            "qp: what about banking, peter? is the banking community seriously interested in these emerging markets and, if you are looking for credit in this world of a credit crunch, can you still get it for emerging market investments?\n",
            "ptl: at the moment, you definitely can. to echo gideon’s point about nigeria, given all the problems that you see there, you would expect that people would steer clear of the country’s banking sector. and yet you find bankers in london and new york talking in glowing terms about the wonderful opportunities in nigerian banking, which may be just another bubble but it is also a sign that political issues do not necessarily get in the way.\n",
            "the other danger, sitting in london, is that we talk about all these markets in terms of their interaction with the west. but there are also huge outflows between the different regions themselves, not just from china into africa but also from the gulf into the indian subcontinent, from china into the rest of asia and so on. one reason why bankers are relatively optimistic about the opportunities in emerging markets is that they think those kinds of trade flows will continue somewhat independently of what happens in the us and the western economies. \n",
            "qp: gillian, which markets are going to make people really excited? \n",
            "gt: before i answer that, following on from peter, i ran into a senior banker recently who had been at the forefront of the structured credit boom in europe and he told me he is now spending about half of his time in sub-saharan africa. it is an illustration of the genius that the investment bank industry has for reinventing itself and following the money and the next big geopolitical hotspot. \n",
            "so, while structured finance, derivatives and financial innovation were the hotspots in previous years, bankers are now looking at emerging markets and battles for resources. it is not just the obvious resources – oil has grabbed a lot of geopolitical attention over the last year or two, but even the humble old issue of food has come back onto the geopolitical agenda. we are seeing some extraordinary bouts of food inflation right now and while that is great news for any hedge funds who managed to get on the right side of the trade a few months ago, it could be potentially very bad news for some of the emerging markets.\n",
            "qp: it is a tough one for china too, isn’t it, chris?\n",
            "cg: it’s a terribly tough one for china because while we talk about china as this very large economy, it is still a very poor economy on average, where a much larger proportion of people’s budgets is made up of food expenditure than in industrialised economies. so, if food prices rise quickly, that means inflation rises much more quickly because it has a much higher weight in the inflation index. more important, it is very bad news for the rural population on which the communist party relies as its power base. \n",
            "one interesting possibility of the changing nexus between emerging markets and the advanced world is that there could be a downturn in the us and the emerging markets could still chug along rather nicely. for america itself, that would be bad news because it would then not see the oil and commodity price falls normally associated with the us economy turning down. so, we could be in for a situation, in advanced economies, where you have rather more inflation than a downturn and a rather stickier time than you have had for quite a few years. not quite back to the 1970s, but nastier than at any time since then.\n",
            "beijing olympics, financial regulation\n",
            "gt: one issue that is going to come out very clearly at davos is that there simply are not any easy answers for western policymakers right now. in terms of steering their economies, in terms of creating monetary and fiscal policy they face some nasty challenges in the next year. putting together a sensible regulatory regime for the banking sector, both to avoid the type of credit boom and bust we have seen from recurring but also to deal with the big problems they currently face, is going to be a tall order.\n",
            "qp: andrew, i want to ask you about the olympics in beijing. how important is that going to be as a global event?\n",
            "aej: it could be the event which makes the difference for the media industry between a terrible advertising year and a decent one. the markets have come down amid the credit squeeze, as consumer-facing businesses have experienced tougher times. so, there is a lot more riding on these olympics to carry the ad year for the media companies than usual.\n",
            "what is also interesting is the companies that are doing the advertising. it is not just the kodaks and the cokes and the well-known us brands, but chinese brands which, apart from one or two well-known names like lenovo, have not really established themselves in the international imagination. can they use that platform to reach a much wider global audience? \n",
            "gr: politically, it is a very important event for china. if it works out well, it will produce an image similar to that experienced by south korea in 1988 and japan in 1964, olympic years for those countries, of an emerging power that is modern and successful. \n",
            "but it could also go wrong for china because there could be big problems with pollution. people are going to be trying to run the marathon in beijing in august, which is incredibly hot and polluted, and if the image that the world gets of the country is of a nightmarish industrial revolution out of control, that won’t be good for china. \n",
            "qp: gillian, what about the us leadership role on the economy. given that the subprime crisis came out of america, are we not going to see people saying, “well, we don’t actually trust the americans to solve the problem either?”\n",
            "gt: i don’t think anybody at the moment trusts the americans to solve the financial problem quickly or easily. right now, washington is muddling through as it tries to deal with the banking problems. we have seen a lot of reaction, but not a lot of proactive policymaking steps. \n",
            "this crisis is unique in that it is the first time we have seen a banking system being recapitalised by a bunch of foreign governments. we have seen plenty of banking systems recapitalised before by their own governments or by private shareholders, but to have foreign governments stepping in is pretty unusual. \n",
            "ptl: the regulatory response will be interesting. some quite serious people in the regulatory world are coming to the conclusion that the financial system is almost ungovernable, that there is nothing you can do to prevent these kinds of events and all you can really hope for is the occasional crisis to clear everything out. \n",
            "if you look back at previous crises, however, they have led to quite serious legislative responses in the us. sarbanes-oxley, for example, was designed to deal with corporate fraud, even though you could argue that it didn’t necessarily do so in the right way. it is not beyond legislators to come up with something that will actually have some far-reaching consequences. \n",
            "gt: the timing of the meeting in davos is interesting because late last year, western policymakers committed to asking the financial stability forum, a kind of central bankers’ club, to produce a list of key reforms that would need to be made on the international stage by this spring. there has been a lot of discussion behind the scenes between central bankers and regulators about what needs to be done next in terms of reshaping the financial system, and that is going to be one of the big talking points in davos. \n",
            "cg: as gillian said, the timetable is really interesting because they want to have a reform plan pretty much agreed by april, when the international monetary fund and world bank hold their spring meetings. so, you will see – or you won’t see, that’s the point – you won’t see the central bankers quietly going off into corners and talking to finance ministers.\n",
            "qp: but that is what they will be doing.\n",
            "cg: that is one of the things that certainly goes on at davos and in some sense this is its most useful purpose. there is a lot of talking shop that tells you exactly where the consensus of opinion is but in terms of things getting done, it is getting done in private.\n",
            "qp: but is it terribly difficult to see it happening?\n",
            "gt: yes, but you can get good clues by looking at the guest list. the fact that you have so many senior us figures bothering to fly across the atlantic to this meeting suggests that they have a strong reason to want to talk to their counterparts in europe right now.\n",
            "one problem is that anyone trying to create policy in the current environment is dealing with a moveable feast and conditions do not necessarily appear to be getting better. \n",
            "iran, oil prices\n",
            "qp: let’s look at iran, one of the potential fault lines of geopolitics in the next 12 months to 10 years. is there any sign of a coherent strategy, gideon, to deal with a nuclear iran?\n",
            "gr: well, i have not met that many people who are actually keen on the idea of a nuclear iran, but there is a big argument about what you do about an iran with nuclear ambitions. how tough do you get? \n",
            "the situation is actually more confused now than it has been for some time because of the us national intelligence estimate, published in december, which appeared to announce that there actually isn’t an iranian nuclear programme. in fact, the report was much more complicated than that but that is how it was read, and the iranians feel that the pressure has been taken off them. the americans, meanwhile, are trying to recover some ground, with president bush giving speeches saying iran is still a big danger. \n",
            "a lot of iran’s neighbours, meanwhile, are ambivalent about the situation: they don’t want the us to attack iran, but they really don’t want a nuclear iran. it is interesting, for example, that oil-rich countries such as the united arab emirates are suddenly announcing that they are getting into civilian nuclear power. i think we are seeing the beginnings of a nuclear arms race in the middle east which is really pretty dangerous.\n",
            "qp: yes, and with france playing a big role, wanting to flog more nuclear equipment.\n",
            "gr: absolutely. people are often pretty cynical about france’s export policy and this is one case where you could argue that it is pretty irresponsible. they are very keen to get out there and sell.\n",
            "qp: so, what is the effect of a continuing divide over iran? and what is going to be the effect on the oil price? is $100 just the beginning or is it going to slip back?\n",
            "gr: if i knew i would be speculating like crazy but my guess is that the long-term trend is probably going to be up, simply because of growing demand for energy in emerging economies such as india and china. the one thing that could ease the situation is if things stabilised in iraq and there was a big increase in the country’s oil production. that could lessen some of the pressure on the oil market in the medium term but over the long term it is going up.\n",
            "gt: earlier this month, the world economic forum published a report in conjunction with various financial institutions including citigroup, marsh & mclennan and swiss re, and it was pretty unequivocal: there is no reason for energy prices to fall any time soon and and think prices are probably going to continue rising. and that is just going to be another pressure on the global economy. \n",
            "food\n",
            "gt: as we have discussed, it is not just energy – we are seeing the soft commodities, the agricultural prices, continuing to rise as well. this is the first davos, certainly in recent memory, where food has been considered such an important issue that it has merited several panels of its own. \n",
            "qp: food, from the perspective of saying how do we grow more or how do we ensure food security? are we going to hear people saying: “gosh, the european common agricultural policy might have been right all along?”\n",
            "gr: interestingly, we are moving from a period when it has been assumed that we are structurally in a situation of agricultural overproduction, at least in the developed world, to one where that may be changing and actually, to pick up on your point, maybe the effort to retain a european agricultural sector wasn’t such a bad idea.\n",
            "at the same time, we were also talking about the impact on the world’s poor of rising food prices as being potentially catastrophic. on the other hand, one of the great cries of recent years has been that the cap and agricultural protection in the west is terribly bad for africa. well, rising food prices could create an export opportunity for african countries. so, it is a double-edged thing.\n",
            "cg: overall, however, you would expect rising food prices to be quite a good thing for most poor countries because that is where the bulk of their economy is based. in fact, it will not be evenly spread. so, countries such as brazil and argentina, which have lots of abundant land and big agricultural sectors, will do very well and some of the poor importing countries – many of which are in africa – will do rather badly. i don’t think any of that is a strong argument in favour of the cap.\n",
            "gt: if you tie together food as a symbol for the bigger themes that are being discussed, we are moving from a world where we have all been focusing on the upside of globalisation in recent years to a world where we are starting to be confronted with some of the potential downsides. \n",
            "qp: what about issues such as genetically modified foods and so on? there has been a big european backlash against that but are we suddenly going to hear people saying: “we really need this sort of scientific breakthrough to deliver the quantity we need?”\n",
            "cg: i don’t think we are short of quantity. rather, the issue is the type of food people are buying. we are seeing, for example, a big increase in meat prices. grain-consuming animals are economically inefficient per calorie produced but this is what richer people like to buy, and as emerging economies become wealthier, there will be large increases in dem\n",

            "the us looks poised to lose its mantle as the world’s dominant financial market because of a rapid rise in the depth and maturity of markets in europe, a study suggests.\n",
            "the change may have occurred already, not least because us markets are beset by credit woes, according to research by mckinsey global institute, a think-tank affiliated to the consultancy. \n",
            "“we think the differential growth rates are so significant that it is quite likely europe has overtaken the us,” said diana farrell, author of the report. \n",

            "the way the world's cities are taking a lead in progressive change gives real force to the slogan 'think global, act local'\n",
            "a good day. it started with a breakfast roundtable discussion, including mayor newsom of san francisco, on how to improve health in cities. we learn he is to introduce a tax on sugared fizzy drinks as part of the fight against obesity. this will involve a struggle with the coca cola corporation - at this very moment, i assume the house un-american activities committee is being revived. cities have led the way on preventative action to improve health - the smoking ban in public places and restaurants started in cities.\n",
            "then, a discussion with the world economic forum, which organise davos, on priorities for the \"mayors' community\" they want to build. this differs from other organisations of mayors in that it brings together cities with the firms that supply them, which has real benefits. there is already a $5bn finance programme, developed between the c40 group of cities fighting climate change and the clinton foundation, on retrofiting builldings to make them more energy-efficient and help reduce carbon emissions.\n",
            "the priority i propose to the wef is the next generation of city buses. it is now possible to produce hybrid-engined buses that drastically reduce carbon emissions and pollution. but today, cities are proceeding in different ways. if we can agree common standards, this would enormously increase markets for bus manufacturers and therefore radically reduce costs for cities. discussing this jointly between cities and manufacturers is a very practical task the wef can help in.\n",
            "also, we were able to make an announcement that had been under discussion in the run-up to davos - that sir martin sorrell, chair of marketing giant wpp, will chair the mayor of london's council of international business advisers in the run up to the 2012 olympic games. this will consist of around 50 ceos and chairs of companies. the goal is to maximise all the international business and economic benefits for london in the lead-up to the olympics.\n",
            "the london reception for the olympic games, at which the announcement was made, was full, and i want to have similar successful events at davos every year as we go forward to 2012. so i regard my chief goal at davos this year, which is to promote london in the four years leading to the olympics, successfully achieved.\n",
            "regarding which, my first davos blog also clarified an interesting aspect of the mayoral election. brian paddick, in a straightforward reply to a straightforward question raised in yesterday's post, added a comment that a mayor should, of course, go to davos to promote london and he would do the same. boris johnson has previously argued that he would close all the offices to promote london in markets such as the us, india, china and europe - a policy which, i should inform him, is greeted with wide-eyed disbelief in a forum of business leaders. the rest of the world is a dominant fact of london's economy - 500,000 londoners now rely for their incomes on jobs in foreign companies and 250,000 are employed by its tourist industry.\n",
            "research by independent economics consultancy dtz shows every job created by a foreign company in london adds £115,000 in extra output to the city, and last year the boost in london's tourist numbers added £600m to its economy. all that translates into tens of thousands of jobs for londoners.\n",
            "davos itself is, of course, entirely dominated by discussions of the economic rise of china and india and the prospects for the us.\n",
            "at lunch, i had a pleasant piece of news. i was informed by itv that they had commissioned a yougov poll after the dispatches programme last monday. i know from previous polling that yougov's polling, which is internet-based, tends to understate my support. therefore, it's nice to be told that even yougov finds that the net result of the six-week campaign of the evening standard against me, and the dispatches programme, was that my lead in the poll had increased!\n",
            "the poll confirms my confidence that londoners pay little attention when the debate becomes out of step with their experiences and that the election for mayor will be decided on the key issues of transport, crime, affordable housing, good community relations and the environment.\n",
            "even with its casts of the super-rich and the super-famous, davos discusses the biggest issues of the world economy among a couple of thousand people, but who take decisions that directly affect hundreds of millions they employ, and which indirectly affects billions of people.\n",
            "what the election in london is about, and what the poll shows, is the most important matter is the impact of some of those same forces on the jobs, incomes, safety, community relations and the environment of everyone in britain, and of londoners in particular. both are aspects of one globalised reality.\n",

            "\"this myth of all these people making sophisticated calculations and trying to game the system, that wasn't it,\" ms. bair says of the event hosted by california gov. arnold schwarzenegger. \"these were just regular people, working families trying to hold onto their homes. they were scared and i saw a lot of fear on their faces, and i think that struck me more than anything.\"\n",
            "the event, like many others, solidified in ms. bair's mind that the federal government needed to take much more aggressive action to stem the record numbers of foreclosures at the center of the growing economic crisis. it also reinforced her belief that compassion should be a key part of the equation for policymakers.\n",
            "\"people say we should punish all these people because they got these mortgages they couldn't afford. why? who is that going to help?\" ms. bair says in an interview in her office overlooking the old executive office building in washington d.c. \"it's just going to put more empty houses on the market, and more houses where the lawn maybe isn't going to get mowed and the windows may be broken, or the owner isn't there so they aren't paying taxes.\"\n",

            "the danes' decision is a climb down, but a rational one. with their last offer only 20 pence away from the level where s&n said it would talk, it would have been churlish not to. sure, carlsberg's share price fell -- maybe because it will now be pretty highly leveraged if a deal happens. it, rather than heineken, is funding the increase. but since its shares have dropped more than 20% since it first approached s&n in october, the incremental damage is small.\n",

            "the other issue is how much carlsberg's and s&n's russian joint venture, bbh, is worth. as part of its concession to carlsberg, s&n wants detailed projections released to shareholders. the risk for carlsberg is that once they know what it knows, shareholders might feel 800 pence isn't so generous after all.\n",
            "that s&n wants the information out there at all suggests it has little intention of going down quietly. after all, it's hard to see s&n's determination to broadcast the bbh figures as anything other than a ploy to rubbish the consortium's bid. indeed, the feisty scots insist their shares are worth 800 pence even without the danes. the trouble is carlsberg is unlikely to blink again. push too hard, and the u.k. brewer's next battle could be with its shareholders.\n",

            "high oil prices have been an obvious boon to the region, but there are other reasons for its appeal. one is a lack of correlation with the rest of the world. while most global markets soared in 2005 and 2006, the gcc index endured a bear market, losing more than half its value. on average, global emerging markets are roughly 70% correlated with standard & poor's composite index of 500 stocks, while for the middle east the match is a negligible 10%, according to t. rowe price.\n",

            "an equity dealer recently told this paper that while there was a lot of political risk in the world, there was no need to worry. the risk, he said, was “priced in”.\n",
            "my first thought on reading this was: how does he know that? indeed, how would anybody know that? the importance of the question lies in what my colleague martin wolf has termed the “davos dilemma” – the contrast between today’s benign global economics and malign global politics. more precisely, we are dealing with a subset of that dilemma: the contrast between soaring equity markets and multiplying risks in the wider world.\n",
            "logically, of course, the fact that world markets are at record highs does not in itself tell us about the pricing of risk. the optimist will argue that without those risks the markets would be much higher again.\n",
            "but how to prove that ? there was a time when strategists would have pointed to the equity risk premium. but recent years have shown us that while the relationship between bond and equity yields may be theoretically interesting, it is no good at telling us where we are.\n",
            "that may be partly because bonds are a nominal class of assets, whereas equities are to some extent real. more fundamentally, pricing equities off risk-free government bonds involves the assumption that those bonds are correctly priced. but it may well be that bonds yields today are too low.\n",
            "so where do we turn for guidance? let us refer back to davos for a moment. the latest edition of the world economic forum’s global risk report identifies 23 categories of global risk, grouped in five categories: economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal (eg bird flu) and technological. no single risk, the report says, became less severe in the course of 2006. most became more so.\n",
            "in the specific area of geopolitical risk, its conclusions are worth quoting. “while expert opinion suggests that geopolitical risk worsened in 2006, market expectations of volatility tended to fall, indicating a major disconnect,” it said. just so. and lest this be thought abstract waffle, consider the report’s authors: citigroup, swiss re and marsh & mclennan, backed up by wharton business school. when the first three of these institutions talk of the markets being disconnected, they are talking from direct experience.\n",
            "what kind of geopolitical risks are we talking about, exactly? some useful work is being done on this by the independent research group oxford analytica. the company proceeds by listing the pressures for and against an event, then checking them continuously.\n",
            "on balance, it reckons, hostilities between china and taiwan or india and pakistan presently look unlikely on a five-year view. but a return to global protectionism looks likely. so does a “major disorder” in central asia.\n",
            "the view on china and taiwan is something of a relief, given that oxford analytica also thinks a conflict there would have the biggest single potential to harm the world economy – worse than an oil price shock or a deep us recession.\n",
            "why might that be? a rather bleak reason is given by one large european institution. its rule of thumb, it says, is that any conflict involving the us poses a greater threat to the markets, simply because of the risk of knock-on effects.\n",
            "thus, war between india and pakistan would seem damaging, given the effect on india as a large emerging market. conflict between north and south korea might seem less material. but the latter, the institution told me, would be more likely to draw in the us, and would therefore provoke a stronger market reaction.\n",
            "whether that is true or not, such conversations suggest there is hard thinking going on about global risk and what to do about it. if and when something goes wrong, such institutions will be better placed to take prompt defensive action.\n",
            "but that is quite different from saying the risks are priced in. that would require the majority of market participants to be thinking along the same lines. and simple observation suggests otherwise – in south america, for instance, where several governments have recently threatened default as a political ploy, yet bond spreads have scarcely widened. and this, i think, is the real problem. it is not that investors are unaware of global risks. rather, they are too used to living on the edge of the volcano. until the eruption proper, another few rumbles are neither here nor there.\n",

            "just two years ago, the russian-backed machine politician was a pariah in the west after he claimed victory in the 2004 presidential elections, which were marred by fraud and a brutal poisoning that left his opponent disfigured. only the subsequent mass street protests of the so-called orange revolution forced him to accept a redo of the vote, which he lost.\n",
            "today, mr. yanukovich, 56 years old, is locked once more in a struggle for supremacy with the pro-western orange leader who beat him, president viktor yushchenko. but this time, the thousands of protesters occupying kiev's independence square for the past month flew not orange, but the blue colors of mr. yanukovich's party of the regions, and the red and hot pink of his allies, the communists and socialists. they dispersed only when mr. yanukovich defused the crisis by agreeing to hold new elections -- for the second time in as many years -- after his rival dissolved parliament.\n",
            "with backing from a billionaire metals baron and political coaching from u.s. sen. bob dole's former campaign strategist, mr. yanukovich was re-elected as prime minister last year. he has positioned himself as a champion of rule of law and democratic values, a visitor to washington, brussels and davos, as well as moscow.\n",
            "mr. yanukovich's comeback is further evidence -- on top of the gaza strip, iraq and kyrgyzstan -- that the free elections encouraged by the u.s. don't guarantee winners who favor u.s. goals, or even western-style democracy. ukraine is adding a fresh twist to the lesson, as mr. yanukovich adopts the language and institutions of democracy to shed the anti-western and antidemocratic image that cost him the election 2&frac12; years ago.\n",
            "gone is mr. yanukovich's bouffant hairdo, a favorite of soviet apparatchiks. so too are the russian advisers and televised meetings with president vladimir putin that characterized his 2004 election campaign, though the russian lower house of parliament, or duma, has issued two statements supporting him in the current power struggle. he says he wants to be the ukrainian leader who starts membership talks with the european union. he even polished his ukrainian, which he now speaks in public instead of his first language, russian.\n",
            "\"time changes people, even viktor feodorovich yanukovich,\" said mr. yushchenko, 53, in an interview. \"but the test is in his decisions and actions,\" he added, accusing mr. yanukovich of trying to \"usurp\" power. mr. yanukovich declined to be interviewed for this story.\n",
            "how far his makeover goes has implications far beyond ukraine. this nation of 48 million is split by history and language, and remains divided over whether to embrace the west or russia. ukraine transports 80% of russian natural-gas exports to the european union, and is key to the energy security of the eu's $15 trillion economy. moscow, increasingly authoritarian at home and assertive with its neighbors, sees ukraine as vital to its own security, economic interests and regional influence.\n",
            "historically, eastern ukraine -- mr. yanukovich's power base -- is closely linked to russia, and most people in the region are native russian speakers. president yushchenko is stronger in predominantly ukrainian-speaking central and western ukraine, which tilts toward western europe.\n",
            "the current crisis began on april 2, when president yushchenko dissolved ukraine's parliament, or rada, and called for early elections. he accused his old rival of engineering a creeping coup by coaxing legislators to defect from other parties to give mr. yanukovich the votes he needs to change the constitution. after a monthlong struggle for power in which mr. yushchenko fired three judges, prime minister yanukovich earlier this month agreed to new elections. but the two men left it to parliament to negotiate a date, and last week mr. yushchenko said he would impose a date if none was settled soon, threatening a further showdown.\n",
            "opinion polls suggest the party of the regions will get the most votes, as it did last year. yet mr. yushchenko's tough action in dissolving parliament and seizing back power is expected to bring some disillusioned orange voters back to the fold, making the contest tight.\n",
            "both viktors claim the legal high ground, but the moral clarity of the orange revolution era has dissipated. \"i'm absolutely disappointed in the way things have turned out,\" said vitaly kutovenko, a 28-year-old banker, as he sipped a beer in the food court of the glitzy globus mall beneath independence square, where mr. yanukovich's supporters were protesting. \"most people are.\"\n",
            "many ukrainians were euphoric after the orange revolution and hoped it would end the corrupt autocracy that had ruled the country since it became independent of the former soviet union in 1991. then-president leonid kuchma and his entourage of business \"clans\" had carved up the proceeds of privatization between them. when mr. yanukovich in november 2004 claimed victory in presidential elections later ruled fraudulent, hundreds of thousands of ukrainians poured into the streets of kiev, setting up camps of pup tents to protest in below-freezing temperatures.\n",
            "mr. kuchma and his anointed candidate, mr. yanukovich, agreed to fresh elections, provided the constitution was changed to transfer some of the president's powers to parliament.\n",
            "the shock of losing the rerun elections, which were held in december 2004, hit mr. yanukovich hard, according to advisers and friends. he found himself in opposition for the first time in his political career and has said his children had to flee the country to escape harassment. in the past, ukrainians in opposition had suffered media blackouts, arbitrary prosecution, a suspiciously high rate of fatal accidents, one murder by decapitation and, in mr. yushchenko's case, dioxin poisoning.\n",
            "that poisoning turned mr. yushchenko's face into a mask of pustules and made him sick. in the interview, he said the effects of the poisoning reached their peak at the beginning of 2006 and required constant treatment. that was a full year after he took office as president, a lost period in which economic growth collapsed as the orange leaders fought among themselves.\n",
            "mr. yushchenko, now revived and showing a new energy and ruthlessness, said he knows who poisoned him, though he won't name names. he said he expects prosecutors to bring charges soon.\n",
            "mr. yanukovich, for his part, says a year in opposition -- he published a book with that title -- taught him the value of a free press and tolerant democracy. \"he really took it deep into his conscience that he needs to understand what happened [in the orange revolution], and what should be changed in his own mentality,\" said konstantin gryshchenko, a former ukrainian foreign minister and now a foreign-affairs adviser to mr. yanukovich.\n",
            "it isn't the first time the former engineer has reinvented himself. growing up near donetsk in eastern ukraine, mr. yanukovich lost his mother at a young age and was brought up by his grandmother. he ran wild and landed in jail twice for assault convictions in his late teens.\n",
            "out of jail, mr. yanukovich was taken under the wing of former soviet astronaut georgi beregovoi. he began a rapid rise in the tough world of post-soviet politics, becoming governor of the donetsk region in 1997 and prime minister in 2002, before the orange revolution cut him short.\n",
            "yet he was by no means washed up politically after his electoral defeat. his rock-solid support in the east won him 44% of the vote in the 2004 presidential election. things brightened dramatically for him in september 2005, after the president fired his prime minister, yulia tymoshenko, breaking up the orange coalition.\n",
            "as mr. yanukovich prepared for parliamentary elections due the following spring, one of his key backers -- rinat akhmetov, a billionaire metals magnate from donetsk -- recommended he hire paul manafort, who had worked on then-sen. dole's 1996 presidential campaign. mr. manafort, now a prominent washington lobbyist, had been advising mr. akhmetov as he explored taking his business, scm holdings, public on western financial markets.\n",
            "with another election fast approaching, mr. manafort declined in an interview to talk about the specifics of the campaign advice he gave mr. yanukovich. but according to people involved in the party of the regions' campaign in spring 2006, mr. manafort advised on such basics as how to target and appeal to voters. he also produced a slick campaign film and coached mr. yanukovich on his presentation.\n",
            "\"this is a person who is now his own man for his own time,\" said mr. manafort, noting that in 2004 mr. yanukovich served under an all-powerful president, mr. kuchma, and had limited latitude. \"his vision is to have a relationship with ukraine's historic neighbors, while integrating with the west over the longer term. like nixon to china, he's the only national leader who can do that.\"\n",
            "the makeover has affected more than mr. yanukovich's campaign style. ambassadors in kiev say that during his previous stint as prime minister, he shied away from contact with foreign diplomats and the media. now he invites briefings and questions, speaking ukrainian even when addressed in russian. he pushed through legislation to take ukraine into the world trade organization, and has promised to pursue a free-trade agreement with the european union.\n",
            "in one example of his new openness, he invited eight local journalists to his home this past march. he talked about how he used to race cars until 1999 -- his favorite was a three-liter ford escort -- and about meeting his wife when she dropped a brick on her foot making deliveries to a factory. they even discussed his two spells in jail, a taboo subject the media were once banned from discussing.\n",
            "\"we were wrong not to talk about that,\" said hanna herman, mr. yanukovich's communications chief. \"he didn't go to jail because he was a terrible criminal, but because he was a young kid on the street with no parents.\"\n",
            "yet some things abut the prime minister may not have changed. a report released last month by the council of europe, the continent's human-rights watchdog, noted growing complaints of arbitrary police raids and harassment of journalists since mr. yanukovich's coalition government took power. it also noted the reinstatement of discredited old-regime officials, such as the head of the central election commission, who oversaw and approved the fraudulent 2004 presidential vote. mr. yanukovich didn't address the report's criticisms, but praised the resolution to which the report was attached, which called for ukraine's constitutional court to decide whether mr. yushchenko's dissolution of parliament was legal.\n",
            "initially, mr. yanukovich didn't have enough allies to form a government after last spring's elections, when the party of the regions became the largest in parliament. but as the orange faction squabbled, a key coalition member, the socialist party, defected. orange politicians have alleged mr. yanukovich's backers paid the socialists $300 million to switch sides. both he and the socialists say no money changed hands.\n",
            "after taking office last august, mr. yanukovich began to tussle with the president over important powers that weren't transferred under the 2004 deal. he quickly reversed mr. yushchenko's policy on the north atlantic treaty organization, halting ukraine's efforts to join the western military alliance. in january, he pushed through a law stripping the president of his right to appoint the prime minister, foreign minister and defense minister, as well as regional governors.\n",
            "for mr. yushchenko, the last straw came in march, when 21 legislators defected to mr. yanukovich from the president's our ukraine party and ms. tymoshenko's bloc. many were businessmen, in a political system where all parties sell parliamentary seats to businessmen who want protection and access to the sale of state assets. the new blood brought mr. yanukovich closer to the 301 votes he needs in the 450-seat parliament to override presidential vetoes or amend the constitution.\n",
            "accepting the defectors \"was a mistake,\" says taras chornovil, a legislator who ran mr. yanukovich's doomed campaign for the 2004 presidential rerun, and whose father -- an opposition leader -- died in a suspicious car crash in 1999. \"we should have known how yushchenko would react,\" he said.\n",
            "mr. yushchenko dissolved parliament, alleging that the defectors were bribed, and re-formed the orange coalition with ms. tymoshenko. mr. yanukovich declared the move illegal and called thousands of supporters into the streets. \"we can't have a president who breaks the constitution,\" said one of them, leonid yermuraki, a 49-year-old veteran of the soviet war in afghanistan. \"the president only represents one part of the country, his people in the west.\"\n",
            "mr. yermuraki was the leader of camp feodosiya, a group of tents just opposite the government building in kiev. he had 63 people here on rotation from the eponymous coastal town in crimea, a fiercely pro-russia area of ukraine. food, medical care, flags and matching raincoats were centrally provided, he said proudly. each morning, his charges joined thousands to march down to independence square to listen to speeches and pop music.\n",
            "most of the protesters have since gone home, but in their echoes of the orange protests, they helped mr. yanukovich's makeover. the party of the regions was \"deeply wounded when the people threw them out\" and needed to have its own version of the orange revolution, said vladislav kaskiv, leader of the pora youth movement, which played a central role in the 2004 protests. he's heartened that people like mr. yanukovich now feel the need to pursue politics in public, rather than in the dark as before 2004.\n",
            "\"my mistake was thinking the orange revolution could sweep out all these business clans at once,\" said mr. kaskiv. \"i was wrong. it's going to be an evolution.\"\n",

            "anew global alignment is emerging that will have profound consequences implications for the shape of the international system. asia and the middle east are often acknowledged as the main theatres within which the key themes of contemporary world politics are being played out. but frequently overlooked is the emerging growing web of ties between these two regions – ties that have as a common theme resistance to american us political, economic, military and even cultural hegemony.\n",
            "the most prominent strand of this new affiliation is energy. while asia has long been dependent been dependentdepended on the middle east for oil and gas, the nature of that relationship is changing. asia has become an even more voracious consumer of middle east of oil and gas, while the middle east’s ties to its traditional energy partner, the us, have become increasingly strained. today chinese, indian, malaysian and japanese energy companies are winning exploration and co-production contracts in the region. in the region. there are undoubtedly sound economic reasons for this. why this is happening. but it no doubt helps that these companies don’tare free of do not come with the the political baggage – a concerns for human rights or nuclear proliferation concerns, for example – that often accompany constrains their american us counterparts.\n",
            "a second strand of the middle east-asia relationship flows from the first: a growing political and, potentially, strategic affinity. take china’s energy investments in iran and sudan. are excellent examples. they are not meant to be a poke in washington’s eye. chinese oil companies do better in these countries because us sanctions mean there is less competition from establishedamerican players. but, given the centrality of energy security to chinese foreign policy, an economic imperative soon becomes a political one. thus, china has opposed the imposition of oil sanctions on sudan and has resisted efforts to raise take the iranian nuclear issue at in to the united nations security council.\n",
            "china’s attractiveness is not, however, limited to the middle east’s rogues. the sino-saudi relationship has developed dramatically since beijing secretly sold medium-range missiles to riyadh in the mid-1980s. more recently a chinese company was one of the first foreigners to be given gain gas exploration rights to explore for gas in the kingdom. the sole us bidder withdrew, ostensibly for commercial reasons. but it probably helped that beijing views the region like washington used to. today the us exports turbulent democratisation while china emphasises stability and the steady flow of oil. \n",
            "of course, china is not yet a viable strategic alternative to the us in the middle east. but this will change. it already has the ability to supply states like such as iran with weapons to “deter” us military designs. - something that would sit comfortably with china’s status quo objectives in the region. china is also acutely conscious of the vulnerability of its long sea lines of communication to the middle east. as it develops its ability to project naval power – it has already helped pakistan build a deep-water port on its west coast – at gwadar - the potential for sino-us strategic competition in the middle east will grow.\n",
            "faith and ideology are other key emerging axes of the relationship. washington tends to view islamic asia’s growing interest in islamic fundamentalism exported by countries such as saudi arabia tends to be viewed by washington largely through the prism of the war on terror. this is simplistic. instead of being driven solely by an interest in extremism, this complex phenomenon is partly a response to what asian muslims see as the penetration of their societies by a decadent and highly commercialised american culture. \n",
            "this is just one example of efforts in asia and the middle east to find alternatives to globalisation’s pervasive american themes. there are others. malaysia has been promoting reform in the islamic world and in october will soon host the inaugural world islamic international forum – a “davos for muslims”. meanwhile, middle east regimes talk about the “china model” of open internationalised economies and closed political systems. while undoubtedly self-serving, such an approach to development may well prove attractive to populations repulsed by the chaos of democratisation in iraq. \n",
            "it would, of course, be wrong to see these various examples of an emerging an emerging asian-middle eastern affinity, some more nascent than others as a formal anti-american alliance. but in many respects it does not matter. regardless of whether the this growing web of ties becomes institutionalised or remains disparate, formed through government and non-government bodies, the net result will be the gradual erosion of american us hard and soft power in both the middle and far east.\n",
            "in the middle east, america’s capacity to reward and sanction will be undercut by regional countries turning eastward for everything from political support in the security council to alternative markets. and investment sources. of investment. in asia, a largely domestically-driven tendency toward a more independent foreign policy outlook will be reinforced by a growing sense that asian and american us interests in the middle east do not necessarily coincide. and globally, it could well be conflict in the strait of hormuz rather than the strait of taiwan that sparks a much-anticipated sino-us rivalry, ultimately challenging the unipolarity that has defined the past 15 years of international politics.\n",

            "davos, switzerland -- immediately after opening the world economic forum annual meeting, british prime minister tony blair offered some clues about how he hopes to manage a tricky balancing act outlined in his keynote speech: vigorously defending u.s. president george w. bush's call for promoting democracy around the world, while simultaneously pressing his own views on issues where he and mr. bush don't always agree.\n",
            "in a wide-ranging interview wednesday night in his hotel room in the posh steigenberger belvedere hotel, a casually attired mr. blair fielded questions from the wall street journal's marc champion, frederick kempe and roger thurow on subjects ranging from terrorism to global warming. below is an edited transcript of their conversation, parts of which appeared in a story in wednesday's edition.\n",
            "q: you have given a strong defense of the u.s. but on the other hand you have taken a high profile on issues where there are significant differences between yourself and the u.s. -- climate change, africa, the middle east. if things don't work out in the way that you had hoped in getting the u.s. support that you need on these issues, are you prepared in the next couple of years, if necessary, to say this is not good enough and we don't agree?\n",
            "a: we should always do and say what we think is right, but it is not sensible leading up to the negotiation to go into it thinking that we will fail. i think people have not marked sufficiently the evolution of american policy. president bush's [inaugural] speech was not just a speech in favor and about the values of freedom and democracy, but a very explicit statement that ultimately the spread of such values is the best form of security.\n",
            "there is on the key issues that face the world today the possibility of pulling reasonable people toward an agreed agenda. and though you say there are differences on the palestinian question, president bush has made it clear now that he favors an independent palestinian state, provided the conditions for that are right and the conditions do not endanger in any way the security of israel. now that frankly would be my position too. on africa, we will have to wait for america's response to the specifics, but again it is worth pointing out that america's commitment, particularly on hiv-aids, is significant.\n",
            "now i believe and hope that we can do more, and america could do more. i think it is really on the issue of climate change where you might say historically there have been clearly different positions. but the important task of the next few months is to see if there is a way that we can bring this agenda together so that the very strong message, which i fully support, on terrorism, security and the spread of freedom and democracy, is matched by an understanding at least that the outer world also sees these issues -- progress on the palestinian question, climate change, africa -- as key priorities.\n",
            "q: are going to continue the sort of relationship that you had in president bush's first term -- keeping your differences out of the public light and staying closely linked to the u.s., even when you do have disagreements, even in war?\n",
            "a: the only question for a political leader in the international arena is do you want to get the job done, or do you want to grandstand? there are exponents of both sorts of political leadership. i prefer to try and get the job done, and it really doesn't help, if there are differences, that you end up with some great public row. it simply makes it more difficult for people to move.\n",
            "on the other hand, on an issue like climate change, we have signed the kyoto protocol and support it; the bush administration has not. it is also the manner in which you then disagree that is important. i have answered my critics in my own country very clearly: i am proud of the american alliance. i think the relationship with america, and my relationship with the american president, is important and right for my country's national interest, and i don't intend apologizing for it to anybody; neither do i intend to start switching into grandstanding. i think that is a pathetic form of leadership and i don't intend to indulge in it.\n",
            "when i heard some of the commentators in my own country describe [president bush's] call to freedom, not tyranny, as neoconservative, i thought that was what we used to be in favor of on the progressive center-left. and what is interesting to me is you have isolationists on the far right and the far left today, as well as people who are in favor of engagement on the center-right and the center-left. so there are all sorts of curious alliances in the world. as i said to someone at one of my party meetings the other day, so far with america we have liberated kosovo and ended up with serbia becoming a democracy and the whole of the balkans for the first time in 100 years being stabilized as a result of our alliance with america. we have brought democracy to afghanistan for the first time, with millions of its people liberated from the taliban. you can argue about the rights and wrongs of the conflict in iraq, but what you can't argue with is that nobody today in iraq wants saddam back and they all want to vote if they are given the chance.\n",
            "now when people then say to me that you have allied yourself with this republican neoconservative, i say, 'look, i can't get into these categorizations.' what i can say is that both with president clinton and then with president bush, we have ended up bringing the possibility of democracy and freedom to people who were previously denied it, and that is something that it is hard to feel sorry for. now the situation in iraq is very tough, of course it is, but it has been made tough because of terrorists and insurgents, not because of us.\n",
            "q: have you gotten any commitments on some of these issues from president bush? will he do more on africa? will he do more on climate change?\n",
            "the world doesn't want america to concede, but it does want it to be engaged. i don't think anyone expects america to suddenly switch positions on a whole set of issues, but it wants america to be engaged in all these issues. so on an issue like climate change, we know there is a debate that is still going on. but on the other hand, this is an issue considered increasingly important by large sections of american opinion, never mind the opinion in the rest of the world. it is important for america to be fully part of that dialogue, to be engaged in it and to help realize the possibilities of moving beyond the carbon economy that is the basis actually for a lot of the investment by america in research. so really it is a question of saying that there are responsibilities on both sides of the international community if we want to bring things back together again.\n",
            "at the end of my speech i spoke about something i have spoken about on many occasions, which is my disagreement with those who want to set up different poles of power in the world. i think this is very dangerous. i think we are best to congregate around one pole of common values. europe and america should be an integral part of that together. they should not have separate and competing poles of power.\n",
            "how do we achieve that? we achieve that by both sides moving closer together and exploring what common ground there is. why should any european be against freedom rather than tyranny? answer: no one should. in the case of climate change, you would be hard put to say there is no evidence to suggest that this is a significant, serious problem. on any basis, too, there are reasons of security of energy supply for getting involved in this debate. so let's see this as a way that we can bring this dialogue forward. now we have not gotten to the stage yet of putting specific proposals to the bush administration.\n",
            "q: could there be some alteration of the kyoto protocol?\n",
            "a: i think those of us who have signed kyoto will keep to kyoto. but in any event kyoto only takes us up to a certain time, and i think the question is how can we make the next dialogue on climate change more productive and fruitful than the last. and my sense is that america does want to be engaged in this debate. it simply does not want to undertake what it regards as unrealistic cuts in emissions that might do damage to its economy. on the other hand, i think i am right in saying america probably invests more into research and technology -- for example in fuel cells and clean coal and so on -- than any other country in the world. so there is something we can build on there, and frankly it is always going to be very difficult to get the world moving together on this issue if america is not part of that. so i am not saying it is impossible, but it is difficult, and particularly for china and india it is difficult.\n",
            "q: has president bush given you a commitment that he is going to move forward on this?\n",
            "a: i think we are best to leave all our discussions for our discussions. these are things obviously we discuss with the administration, but it is for the administration to declare its policy on it, not me.\n",
            "q: why do you think this audience in davos needed to hear such a defense of u.s. policy?\n",
            "a: i think in europe it is important that we constantly restate the value of the american alliance. i am shocked occasionally at how people view it today. i also believe that the disagreement with america is far more superficial than sometimes it seems. i did a debate with a whole lot of young people on television, and i said at one point that america's values are our values. they disputed that. then after the program ended i actually had a discussion with them, and in fact when you go through it and you say, 'look, these are the values that america believes in. you may not agree with this administration or that administration, but the basic values that america stands for are the same as ours.' and people get it once you get into the debate.\n",
            "but it is necessary at the moment to restate the importance of the alliance and i have fought for this continually. in britain, there are significant numbers of people, including in our media, who want me to give up the american alliance, who want me to give up the european alliance, and who now tell me i should give up both alliances. here is britain in the early 21st century, an island nation with a population of 60 million. we have got the two best alliances you can have in the world and people want me to give up both of them. sort of crazy stuff. many in that [davos] audience would probably agree with the american alliance, but i think for the outside european audience it is necessary to restate it.\n",
            "q: many in europe are arguing that the u.s. should have been pressuring israel more on working toward middle east peace, and that tony blair should have put more pressure on george w. bush to pressure israel more. where do you see your differences? what needs to be done in the middle east?\n",
            "a: the deal that i think america is putting on the table for the middle east is we will take this forward and go for a negotiation that leads to an independent palestinian state, but only on these terms: that the structures of such a state must be democratic, the economy must be transparent and the security structures must be effective. and the trouble with some of the debate in europe on the palestinian issue is that it simply ignores the fact that israel has suffered from terrorism. terrorism is a blight on the middle east peace process and on the palestinian hopes and ambitions, and this is what is so tragic about it. since the intifada began, what has happened to the palestinian people? they have gone backwards.\n",
            "i think [president bush] is saying, 'look, i will take this forward if i have partners for it.' i think he believes that with the new palestinian leadership he has a potential partner there. the one thing i know is that if he says he will do it, he will do it. but the reality of american policy, whatever president is in charge, is no american president is going to endanger the security of israel, and actually they are right not to do that. but if the palestinian state that is created is one that is democratic, then his view -- and my view -- is that it will be a stable partner for israel. what he would not want is to help create a palestinian state that, for example, was undemocratic, or a haven for terrorism. there is a reason why in israel the peace party has been pretty marginalized in the past few years -- indeed since the intifada -- and that is because many people in israel felt that [former] prime minister ehud barak gave a pretty good offer on the table (during the clinton administration) and it was rejected. this is the importance of the london conference (in march, attended by palestinian but not israeli leaders).\n",
            "now if we can get the international community signed up to an agreed set of structures for the politics, the economy, the security issues, the whole of the international community will expect, if the palestinians really do step up to the mark on these things, that america takes this forward. now president bush has said he will, and i believe him. after what happened between barak and [late palestinian leader yasser] arafat -- where president clinton performed heroics in getting [near an agreement] but ending up without a deal in the end -- you were not going to get another american president who was going to take this forward until he was absolutely sure that on both sides people really wanted to do it. now i think the new palestinian leadership, the disengagement plan, the fact that the israeli government is now reconfigured as well, offers us that opportunity, provided that we do the detailed work to make sure that the palestinians are helped in the way that they need.\n",
            "q: is there anything that you specifically want from the u.s. on the middle east that they are not doing now?\n",

            "a: we are working with the africa commission, which has representatives from the main developed countries, but also from the african countries. that will report in march and that will hopefully give us the agenda that we can take forward at the g-8. i think we are storing up a pack of trouble for ourselves in africa. there is a reason of enlightened self-interest to tackle it, although i think the moral case is obviously very strong. i am also struck by the fact that there are many church groups, there are people like [u.s. senate majority leader] bill frist, people in the u.s. who are very passionate about the subject. obviously president clinton is, too. so i think there is a strong body of support. what we have tried to do with the africa commission is get that mixture of the hard head and the warm heart.\n",

            "a: i have been passionate about this subject ever since i got involved in politics because i just think it is so cruel and tragic. i also think that if what happens in africa happened in any other continent in the world there would be a complete and total outcry. when i saw the very proper response to the tsunami, i felt that you need to mobilize some of that solidarity for what is a continuing tragedy, not on the television screens every night, but is preventable.\n",

            "a: quite apart from the obvious -- just keep pressing on with aid and debt relief and so on -- i think the two things are opening up trade and markets, and conflict resolution. you can with the right programs help the killer diseases, although that does require a real african response as well. but the two things that the world could do with the political will that wouldn't actually involve the expenditure even of vast sums of money, would be to open up markets and to build the african peace-keeping capability. we could train the people, we could finance it. if you had a rapid-deployment force able to go into any of these areas and keep the peace, the deterrent effect would be enormous. in any of these countries often what happens is these rebel groups or groups of marauding militia can just eliminate vast swathes of people. and you have this terrible situation of kids being made into soldiers at the age of 12 and 13. if this was happening in europe, or in asia, or in south america, people would be going crazy with it.\n",
            "q: what would you like the history books to say about the prime minister tony blair?\n",
            "a: despite what people often say, i never worry too much about that because you can never tell, because the judgment in history is usually completely different -- not always, but often. we are at a particular moment in time when there are critical issues capable of political leadership and resolution that would make a big difference. post sept. 11, this issue of global terrorism and how you deal with it is a huge challenge. obviously these long-term issues of climate change and helping africa, they are big, big questions that face the world today. the world i grew up in had a clear division and two very clear camps -- you had the west and the soviet bloc. ever since the soviet union thankfully collapsed, and eastern europe changed, there has been a question whether the world reunifies around a strong common global agenda, or whether it drifts off into these different poles of power. i think the next few years is a very, very crucial moment of opportunity and of danger. it is an opportunity because i think it is possible to find a unifying agenda, and it is a moment of danger because if you don't and people split into their rival powers, then i think whatever people say, that competition will be unhelpful. so what do i think my legacy is? what do i think my priority is? to try and see if we can find that unifying agenda.\n",

            "sbc communications, the second-largest u.s. regional phone company and one of the three mammoth telecoms to emerge from the baby bells' consolidation, is in talks to buy at&t, the new york times and the wall street journal report. citing executives close to the negotiations, the times describes the talks as \"fluid\" and \"very, very sensitive,\" and puts a possible price at above $16 billion. but it cautions that a deal could still collapse and that many issues, including the price, had yet to be resolved. the journal, citing people familiar with the matter, says executives at both companies were still at it last night by phone and in person. a deal would put together some of the largest pieces of the ma bell telephone monopoly broken up in 1984, linking sbc's 50 million local-line customers with at&t's international fiber network -- the world's largest -- and its deep client list of major corporations. such clients are considered valuable, the times notes, because they buy services in bulk.\n",
            "and like rivals bellsouth and verizon communications, sbc in recent years has sought to compensate for the decline in subscribers and revenue from its fixed-line business by pushing broadband-internet connections and other services, including plans to provide video in coming years. for at&t, the deal would come as it struggles with a vicious long-distance price war with mci and the baby bells themselves. the times suggests regulators would be unlikely to block a merger because of at&t's diminished role in the industry. but the journal says an sbc-at&t link-up would anger consumer groups concerned about the shrinking choices among telecom operators, and that such worries could indeed draw substantial regulatory scrutiny. another key question, the journal says, is how verizon would respond, as well as bellsouth, which itself broke off similar talks with at&t in 2003. the talks follow a flurry of industry m&as, and the journal says bellsouth is already evaluating its own options, including possible deals with at&t or mci.\n",

            "\"but more than the policies themselves, it was gonzales's uninformative responses to senators' questions that seemed to infuriate the democrats most,\" newsweek says. \"in his confirmation hearing three weeks ago and his later written responses, gonzales time and again told senators 'i do not have a specific recollection' or 'i do not recall' when asked about positions he took on these and other issues.\" the democrats' incredulity was increased by mr. gonzales's failure to remember stands he personally took and details of meetings he had previously acknowledged took place. still, the magazine says, mr. gonzales is expected to be confirmed by the full senate, if by a far narrower margin than initially anticipated.\n",
