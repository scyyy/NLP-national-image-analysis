# NLP-national-image-analysis
### Start with spider, end with conclusion.
Massive media news is an important information resource for the national image study in the era of big data, and text mining techniques offer a new approach for identifying national image from news. This paper uses text mining techniques to identify China‚Äôs economic image from mass media news on Davos Forum. Specifically, the paper analyzes the basic representations of national image, and uses text mining techniques to identify China‚Äôs economic image and the changes. Further, China‚Äôs economic images are compared between countries and news media. The results help understand China‚Äôs economic images and the changes, and are also potentially meaningful for research and practice on media image of country, region and city.
